This was due to an outstanding payment of R77million owed to the contractor. The undertaking to resume construction was made during a visit by Premier David Makhura and Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga. Community liaison officer Ernest Aphane yesterday told the Pretoria News that Msimanga promised that payment to the contractor would be made in two months. “He said the City has undertaken to pay the main contractor in instalments of R10m,” he said. The project was stopped in May last year. According to Msimanga, the stalling was due to a group of businesspeople who were disgruntled, after they could not get work during the construction phase. However, the project managers disputed the claim and said the stoppage was caused by construction plans which had not been approved before the construction. Launched two years ago by former mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa, the first phase of the project was expected to be completed by February this year.
