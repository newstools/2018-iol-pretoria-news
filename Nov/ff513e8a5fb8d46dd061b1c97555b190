Members of the media and beer connoisseurs got a sneak peak into the festival, set to take place over two days from Friday at the Sun Arena at Time Square. The launch was at the Brew Monkey at Time Square in Menlyn Maine, where Tops at Spar Bierfest producer, Andrew Douglas, said they were excited to have finally brought the Bierfest to Pretoria. “We have already been to places like Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Sun City and for the first time we are now here in Pretoria. “We are really excited about this and we hear Pretoria is thirsty so we will definitely quench the thirst,” he said. Nadia de Klerk, of Cape Brew Company, also promised nothing but a good time to local revellers. Attendees can expect to play games while enjoying beer. The games include milking a cow, sawing a log, playing air guitars and curling a bierstein - and winners will head home with a prize. Organisers also said that beer lovers who stand out as the best dressed Biervarian will walk away with a cool prize. Celebrating its eighth year now, the bierfest brings connoisseurs no less than 10 beers on tap, all provided by smooth hoperator and chairman of the South African Craft Bier Association, Wolfgang Koedel, and his crackling Cape Brewing Company. Tickets range from R175 to R1175, and each amount offers a different package. A group ticket option is also available for those who want to sit around a table and enjoy time with friends and colleagues. Booking for tables are available for six or eight members, they said. The event will take place on Friday from 7pm to midnight, Saturday lunchtime from 12pm to 5pm and Saturday evening 7pm to midnight.
