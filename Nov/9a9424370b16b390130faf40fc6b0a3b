Pretoria - Scores of angry residents and EFF members have flooded the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court to witness self-proclaimed prophet William Emeka appear on charges of rape and sexual assault. The community has been furious after allegations that Emeka was raping and sexually assaulting several members of his church. Bronkhorstspruit EFF members joined forces with locals to burn the Emeka's main church branch in Rathabiseng earlier this month as soon as cases were opened with the police. The community against the foreign national prophet last week clashed with church members who supported Emeka, claiming that he was innocent and framed. This led to a scuffle inside the courtroom as soon as Magistrate David Shikwampane adjourned proceedings. A pregnant woman supporting the prophet started crying that she was poked on her stomach and was rushed to theÂ hospital for medical attention.  However, the community that wanted Emeka to be prosecuted and convicted dismissed the woman's claim and said she was trying to get sympathy for the prophet and that would not work where justice was concerned. The community and EFF members are not in the courtroom displaying scores of placards with messages against Emeka. They likened him to controversial pastor Omotoso who is also accused of raping several members of his congregation. Emeka is expected to make his formal bail application on Thursday as it was postponed last week Thursday due to pending confirmation of his immigration status from the Department of Home Affairs.
