Gauteng NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana told reporters who had gathered at the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court that the bail hearing would not continue yesterday as scheduled. “The postponement won’t affect the bail application proceedings as such. It’s only that the court had matters that had to proceed today and therefore could not accommodate the bail application,” said Mjonond-
wana. “It’s only fair to the other accused as well that they have their matters proceeding in court, hence this postponement.” Tshabalala was in court last week and the bail application was postponed to yesterday. The crime intelligence officer faces charges including theft and defrauding the slush fund of the SAPS crime intelligence unit of more than R500000. According to the charge sheet, in one instance Tshabalala defrauded the SAPS by falsifying a claim of R470 000 “needed to pay for blinds and curtains for a safe house” and he pocketed more than R200000 from it. He also faces a charge of corruption relating to R50000 he received. Tshabalala was arrested by police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) officers last week outside the Correctional Services headquarters in Pretoria. He was there to meet his parole officer. Despite having at least two criminal convictions for armed robbery, masterminding a cash-in-transit heist and attempted murder, Tshabalala had the highest police clearance and was employed by the crime intelligence unit. “Captain KGB” was arrested in 1994 and convicted in 1996 for robbery with aggravating circumstances. He was sentenced to 10 years behind bars. After serving just over two years, at Groenpunt Maximum Correctional Service Centre, Tshabalala was freed. He was re-employed by SAPS after he was released on parole. - African News Agency (ANA)
