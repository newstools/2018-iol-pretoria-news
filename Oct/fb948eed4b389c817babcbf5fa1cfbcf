OPHTHALMOLOGISTS at Kalafong Tertiary Hospital aim to operate on 100 patients with cataracts to commemorate Eye Care Awareness Week. Dr Hamza Tayob said most of their patients were pensioners as a cataract was age related. He said as one gets older, excessive UV light like sunlight and any illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension contributed to cataracts forming. "Cataracts are the number one cause of reversible blindness in Africa and we have thousands of patients on the waiting list. "All the patients here have one eye operated on, they will have to wait another period of time for their next eye to be operated on because we have to give everyone a chance to get at least one cataract done," he said. Tayob explained that a cataract operation was the removal of an old eye lens, replacing it with an artificial one. He said: "Because we put an artificial lens in, patients can't get a second cataract because the artificial lens is plastic. Many of these patients have not seen their families for 10 years and we get to see the impact this operation has when we open the patch for the first time after the operation.‚Äù He said although this was a small, quick 20 minute operation, it was life changing. And with the assistance of sponsors, Tayob said his team; Dr Kabelo Sebogodi, Dr Isanang Malope and Dr Sibongile Mthetwa managed to operate thirty-five patients over the weekend. More patients are to be operated on this week.
