SAKHILE NDLAZI The accuracy of weather and other climate measuring will now be more precise and accurate following the signing of a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between the South African Weather Service (SAWS) and the National Meterology Institute of South Africa (NMISA). The Chief Executive Officers of NMISA and SAWS, Ndwakhulu Mukhufhi and Jerry Lengoasa, today signed a MOU at the CSIR. The main objective of the MOU is to define the basis of the collaboration between the SAWS and the NMISA, who have joined forces to work together to promote the importance of having accurate measurement traceability. According to the agreement, NMISA will advise and work together with SAWS in various fields of research such as securing resources for research projects to improve the National Measurement Standards; traceability issues with regards to gases; bursary opportunities to students in the applicable fields of joint research and project agreements for research and consulting projects, with details of scope, deliverables and costs. The MOU intends to strengthen scientific and technical bases by developing ambient level primary reference gas materials for the World Meteorological Organization and the Global Atmospheric Watch Program at Cape Point. These reference materials will be developed for aerosol, greenhouse gases, reactive gases for air quality, and both SAWS and NMISA will conduct co-operative scientific research related to the above-mentioned gases. It also seeks to strengthen flow, pressure, temperature, wind, radiation and photometry calibration capabilities and technical bases for development of halocarbons gases, perfluorocarbons gases for air quality. “Weather and climate  play an integral part of our daily decision making. People tend to just believe weather at face value without questioning its authenticity. That is where NMISA comes in, they are going to ensure that the weather measuring is accurate, among other things said,” said Lengoasa.
