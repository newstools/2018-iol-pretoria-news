Judge Ramarumi Monana, however, turned down the application by the family of Dr Hoosen Haffejee, who wanted to be admitted as an intervening party, as there was no finding that Roderigues was involved in the killing of Haffejee. The family of another allegedly murdered anti-apartheid activist, Mathews Mabelane, will join the National Prosecuting Authority in opposing Roderigues’s application. The Timol family, and that of Haffejee and Mabelane, voiced their fear that if Roderigues was successful, all the other families of apartheid-era victims would be deprived of knowing the truth. Ex-security policeman Roderiques, 80, appeared in July in the high court over Timol's murder in the early 1970s. But he wants the charges dropped, claiming his prosecution was unfair due to the delay of 47 years in charging him. During the historical reopening of the Timol inquest last year, Judge Billy Mothle ruled Timol was murdered and recommended to the NPA that Roderigues's role in it had to be probed. The judge also ruled at the time that former security branch officers Neville Els and Seth Sons be charged for perjury. Timol’s nephew Imtiaz Cajee, who was instrumental in reopening his uncle’s inquest, said that more than a year later, a decision was yet to be made if Sons and Els will be charged. Cajee said yesterday they were happy the Timol family could join the fight against Roderigues’s application, but were concerned that his application would further delay his criminal trial. He also expressed concern that the NPA did not investigate Timol’s death much earlier, as requested. “I have written a letter to the NPA in 2002.” The court ruled last year Timol did not commit suicide, but was murdered in 1971 when he was pushed out of the window and plunged to his death from John Vorster Square. Haffejee and Mabelane died under similar circumstances.
