That’s it! viewers have run out of patience with Scandal's latest villain, Mthunzi Mayisa. The only hope most viewers had that Mthunzi will finally go down was his mother Dambisa Maduna, but when she had a heart attack before she could reveal the truth about his fake identity, viewers completely lost it and vented their frustrations on social media. They even threatened to stop watching the drama series after last night’s episode. The role is portrayed by South African Film and Television Awards (Safta) winner Bongile Mantsai, 33, and is driven by revenge. It has been stirring up viewers’ emotions since his debut. On the second day of his wedding last night, viewers were hopeful that Dambisa would come to their rescue and finally help the character get exposed as they are “over him now.” But no, she fainted and was rushed to hospital. Out of defiance, Xolile wanted the ceremony to go ahead and she and Mthunzi were married. Mthunzi later visited his mother and told her that it was punishment for defying the ancestors' wishes, which she swore never to defy them or oppose him again. In the e.tv series, he is the son of a domestic worker Dambisa , who worked for the rich Langa family, but none of the family members know it. He hates the family after he once, as a child, visited his mother at work and had a bad experience there. This left him feeling unwanted and disrespected and he grew up to resent them. So to get back at them Mthunzi kidnapped and killed businessman Siseko Langa (Hlomla Dandala), out of revenge and to get to his millions. He faked his way into running the law firm Langa had put his son Chumani (Ayanda Daweti) in charge of. Soon after that he had the Langas eating out of his hand, becoming the chief executive, but leaving Chumani in doubt of him. He even manipulated his way into the heart of Chumani's sister Xolile’s (Sivenathi Mabuya) and they finally tied the knots. Here are some of the reactions on Twitter about the episode:
