Pretoria - Artist Lebani Sirenje also known as "Rasta" never seizes to amaze with his paintings. Sirenje has once again been accused of having “had too much weed” before paying tribute to local rapper Jabulani "Jabba" Tsambo through his painting. This was just one of the many comments posted on social media after the artist arrived at Newtown Music Factory in Johannesburg to express his grief through art where the rapper is being remembered. Tsambo well known by his stage name HHP (Hip Hop Pantsula) died on Wednesday last week after allegedly committing suicide at his Randpark Ridge, Joburg home. Twitter users are saying the man depicted in the artwork is not HHP and that he needed to paint that “stranger in front of his own house”. Through his paintings, Sirenje has paid tribute to late celebrities and prominent figures, including former president Nelson Mandela, Struggle icon Albertina Sisulu, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and gospel stars Lundi Tyamara and Sfiso Ncwane. Here are some of the reactions:
