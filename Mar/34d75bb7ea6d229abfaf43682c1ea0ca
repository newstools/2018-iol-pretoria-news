VIRGILATTE GWANGWA 
virgilatte.gwangwa@inl.co.za TAKING an oath to make reading their daily bread are Grade 6 pupils from various city schools who are gathered at Voorspos Primary School in Waverly, Pretoria today. The oath by pupils comes after the City commemorated South African Library Week at the school with the aim to promote libraries and influence the culture of reading in the city. Under this year's theme "Libraries, the heart of the Community" chairperson of the oversight committee for community and social development, Thabisile Vilakazi said the theme was aimed to encourage a sense of ownership within each community. She said they wanted to make libraries an indispensable part of their everyday lives and denounce the notion of destroying libraries.

"Communities need to understand that by burning libraries, they don't only burn the facilities but they are destroying the future of their children and also destroying the future of the country. People fail to understand that children are the future, they are the ones mostly using libraries for research; some which will benefit the society at some point," she said. Vilakazi said they targeted the Grade 6 pupils as they wanted to teach them about the importance of reading while they're still at a young age. Tsholofelo Merementsi from Greenwood College told her counterparts to always go to the library and read. "It is a quite and peaceful space to read in, you can do your research and homework in peace.  Reading is fun and libraries are the perfect place to read," she said.
