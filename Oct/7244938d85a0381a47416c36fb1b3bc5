Business has its ups and downs and its all about how you deal with it.” Msimanga said that Jean Avenue had been closed for almost two years and as work commenced another sinkhole developed. “I’ve been assured by the team who fixed the road that it is now one of the safest roads in the area because the technology that has been used here guarantees nothing should form again. “It has cost the city over R25 million and that’s what was needed to fix this even though it appeared small. "We’re still going to engage with businesses and do whatever we can to help them advertise and bring life back to their businesses.” Jean Avenue will be officially reopened by the mayor tomorrow morning.
