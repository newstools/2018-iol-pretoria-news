The project will be rolled out at the Mokopane Biodiversity Centre in Limpopo. It was founded in conjunction with the national Pet Recycling Company and the City of Tshwane, and will be operated by the Umkariso Women in Water co-operative. It forms part of the zoo’s environmental management plan. Marcel Singh , the acting manager for commercial services and business development at Pretoria Zoo, said: “This project forms part of the environmental management plan, and recycling is just one area in which we are committed to expanding our green footprint.” Singh said the project was also aimed at addressing the massive litter problem that the zoo’s thousands of annual visitors left in their wake. “In implementing the waste hierarchy of reduce, reuse and recycle - we are also waging a war on littering, which is a huge problem. We are in the concept phases of developing environmental campaigns aimed at reducing our plastic waste and educating visitors.” So far, five previously unemployed Tshwane residents have benefited from the project. “They have been trained and appointed to collect and sort the high volumes of recyclable materials generated daily by the zoo’s restaurants, curio shops, offices, research facilities, animal kitchens and veterinary hospital,” Singh said. Pet Recycling Company chief executive Cheri Scholtz commended the zoo for taking a proactive stance on waste management.
