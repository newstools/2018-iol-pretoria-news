It was a jampacked day with fashionistas, art lovers, foodies, socialites, families and couples from Pretoria and afar having fun. The festival is a collaboration between Market@The Sheds and the Embassy of Brazil which focuses on the synergies between Mzansi and Brazil, providing a showcase of local and Brazilian music, art, food, design and entertainment. Visitors indulged in Portuguese, Indian, Brazilian, Italian and South African cuisines from a variety of gourmet pop-up stalls. From craft cocktails to delicious street foods with a touch of traditional flair, there was something for everyone to enjoy. For entertainment, there were artists keeping music lovers on their feet the entire time. There were soccer kids, some world class Jiu Jitsu, a Brazilian dance presentation by students of TUT, the South African Capoeira foundation and more Brazilian dance fusions including dance classes. Attendees also purchased unique items made by local craftsmen and artists, including bags and clothes. Khosi Dube from Studio Khosi was among the sellers. She said the festival allowed her to interact with clients face to face as she always did so online. “I’m finding it very interesting because this is my first time interacting with clients because normally I deal with them online. “We are selling women's clothes they're Victorian and vintage inspired.” Dube said she would definitely be back next year. Fhumulani Thagisa and Tshifhiwa Ndou from Midrand said they had the time of their lives. With African influences and Brazilian flair, Thagisa said it was indeed an experience to remember. “It is my second time coming here. I told my friend about it and as you can see, it’s lively here and we are definitely coming back next year. “I’m enjoying the dance and definitely loving the food,” she added.
