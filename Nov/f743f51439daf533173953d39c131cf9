Good help is hard to find - so how do you keep it? Engagement! It affects morale, builds trust, mitigates conflict, encourages communication, and increases collaboration. The most successful engagement activities are ones that don’t feel like a day at the office: spending time together, sharing an experience or working towards a common goal allows bonding to happen more organically and far more effectively. But that probably can’t happen at the rugby - what if the home team loses? It’s unlikely to happen on the golf course - you’re too spread out most of the time. Your best bet is when you can enjoy each other’s company around a table in a festive carnival atmosphere with great food and even better vibes. We believe beer brings everyone together - for thousands of years humans have bonded over bowls of this liquid gold. Your company could take you all to a 5-hour power party Oktoberfest-style, with your own bierstein, Biervarian accessories, a traditional meal, and your own fräulein to bring you a selection of 10 delicious beers from as little as R535 per person. Everyone loves Bierfest: the live music acts and activity stages will keep everyone entertained and our full bar also features selected gems from the TOPS at SPAR Olive Brook Private Label range to tempt the most discerning of palates. The TOPS at SPAR Bierfest, proudly poured by CBC and in association with Pretoria News, is coming to Time Square today and tomorrow and their corporate packages are wunder- bavarian! Staff Reporter
