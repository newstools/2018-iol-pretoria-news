Mosola’s spectacle came on the back of a Labour Court victory successfully challenging the tabling of a damning draft preliminary investigation report into allegations of irregularities on the GladAfrica tender. An emboldened Mosola called a media briefing via a PR agency run by Onkgopotse JJ Tabane, fired by the SABC and Power FM after being implicated in conduct unbecoming by acting GCIS director-general Phumla Williams at the Zondo Commission as then communications minister Faith Muthambi’s adviser. On Friday and Saturday, Mosola showed the middle finger to his boss with a Facebook posting claiming the DA and Msimanga wanted to tarnish his good name. Mosola knows full well it was the collective council that resolved to commission an external, independent investigation. The ANC and his ally the EFF supported the urgent need for a probe. Upon seeing the report’s preliminary findings, Mosola bunked a special mayoral committee last Monday to consult his attorneys in Joburg to interdict the Bowmans report. He rejoined exco only after lunch. He claims not to have seen the report, which is balderdash - what would be the logic interdicting a report that cleared him? His desperate, failed attempt to interdict a Sunday newspaper from publishing the report questions the long-held suspicion of Mosola’s denials. His subordinates and the people of the City - not the DA or the multiparty council - should demand the truth and to see the report which Mosola so feverishly tried to conceal. His actions are not that of an innocent person. What example is Mosola setting? Why do you fear an independent, external probe and want an internal one by your subordinates? * Mudzuli is Pretoria News assistant editor. He writes in a personal capacity.
