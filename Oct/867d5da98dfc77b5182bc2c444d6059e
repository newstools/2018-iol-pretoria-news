The municipality was considering re-imposing water restrictions to preserve water, he said. The Department of Water and Sanitation this week released a report indicating that dams had filled up. But Moss said: “As a City we believe that the rate our demand for water is at means we could find ourselves in the same position as Cape Town if we experience just two years of drought. “We really cannot afford that, and that’s why we think more about the long-term instead of the present. “The Vaal Dam is full, but Rand Water restricts our supply, so we should also be more careful with the water that we have. Water is a very important resource for our residents and we advise them to use it sparingly irrespective of our dam levels." Although the report indicated that the rains have had little effect on the country’s average dam levels as they had decreased slightly from 74.5% to 73.8%, the City confirmed that its dams levels had increased. The South African Weather Service has predicted more rains in most parts of the country for next week. It warned residents to be on high alert for possible flash floods. In the past week, the Bon Accord Dam capacity has increased from 98.5% to 115.8%, Roodeplaat Dam from 99.6% to 100.9%, Rietvlei Dam from 94.6% to 98.0%. Bronkhorstspruit Dam remains at 97.4% capacity.
