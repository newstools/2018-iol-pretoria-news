Monica Maphumulo’s life is at a complete standstill. Home Affairs records indicate that Maphumulo is deceased and the cause of death is natural, but the Pretoria North mother is very much alive and healthy. She shared the horrors of her story with the Pretoria News. The 26-year-old said she can’t even register her son who's now eight months old as her ID is required. A death certificate indicating that she passed away in May 2015; with the same ID number as the one in her ID book was shown to the Pretoria News. She recalled the day she found out about her “mysterious demise” last year, when she had gone to withdraw money. “I went to the tellers to take out money and I was told “we can’t give you the money because you’re deceased.” I went to Home Affairs and they told me that maybe someone had a duplicate ID. “It’s been almost a year that I’ve been trying to sort this thing out. I filled out forms and was told to give it six months but still nothing.” “I had savings but I can’t even access the money since all my bank accounts are frozen. I can’t  even apply for a job, my life has stopped,” she said. Maphumulo said she had gone as far as providing Home Affairs with her grade 1 progress report to prove that she was still alive. “I got a copy of my birth certificate, injection card, discharge card, a letter from my primary school but they also want a copy of my register which the school no longer has,” she said. The Department of Home Affairs is yet to comment.
