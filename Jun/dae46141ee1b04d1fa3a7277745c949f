This follows recommendations by Parliament’s communication committee to deal with editorial interference as well as other allegations of misconduct, she said. "This is also part of ongoing work to transform the public broadcaster into a truly accountable and responsive corporate entity. Regarding the sex for jobs allegations, we can assure staffers that confidentiality is guaranteed. The inquiry will extend to external people such as suppliers and freelancers, to come forward if they were pressured to do favours in exchange of work," Philiso said. "We will also look at news diaries between 2012 and 2018, but will allow people to go back to before 2012 if they have information to share with the inquiry that inquiry will not cover political diary influence only, but business influence s well as NGOs we need to be beyond reproach as we head to elections.’’ The sexual harassment inquiry will start today until the end of July. An email address will be set up specifically for complaints. Boxes will also be available at SABC regional offices for victims to submit written complaints. Every complainant would be able to state their case before the inquiry, said Philiso. A judge would chair the sexual harassment inquiry, while the editorial interference probe would be led by executive director of the Press Council, Joe Thloloe. - African News Agency (ANA)
