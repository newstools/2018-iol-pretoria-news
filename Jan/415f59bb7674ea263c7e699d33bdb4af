Msimanga proudly spoilt the youngsters with the money that would make a huge difference on their new journey to acquiring tertiary education. He said he was very proud of the boys and girls from the capital who made the province’s top performers list and would be proud to see them as career women and men some day. “We also congratulate all the other Grade 12 pupils who wrote and passed the National Senior Certificate exams in Gauteng and the rest of the country. The pupils achieved a national pass rate of 75.1%, a 2.6% improvement from the 72.5% achieved in 2016. This, represents a total of 401435 candidates, who had passed the 2017 examinations. “Tshwane also made its mark in the top 10 performing districts in the country with progressed pupils included placing Tshwane South and Tshwane North districts in third and fifth positions. On this note I salute Jacqueline Janse van Rensburg from Hoërskool Oos-Moot in Pretoria for scooping the top-performing matriculant spot in Gauteng. “Jacqueline received nine distinctions, including the third best mark in advanced programme mathematics in the country. I take my hat off to you. You are an inspiration to many young women in the city and the country at large." Msimanga said his administration took great interest in the performance of its pupils because education was everybody’s business, and a societal matter.
