For months, employees at the Civitas building on the corner of Thabo Sehume and Struben streets have protested against what they called poor working conditions. Among the issues they raised were ventilation systems, activators and sprinkler systems in the building which were not in working order. Things were further aggravated after heavy rains collapsed the ceiling on the 8th floor last weekend. Public Servants' Association chairperson Peter Moloi said the status quo remained, and most of the issues they had been raising throughout the year had not yet been dealt with. Moloi said as a result, even though workers were reporting for duty, they were working from the foyer and refusing to go into the offices. He said although the rains affected one floor, other challenges still existed. The inspectors, along with a departmental representative, had started going through the building level-by-level last week Thursday. “We’re happy that they (inspectors) are here and are finally realising the issues workers have been crying about. “They are finally taking this seriously and not letting the department pass the buck. “The department failed to conduct routine maintenance for years and that is the reason the building is in such a poor state.” Moloi said he was happy that the inspectors were demanding records of maintenance conducted on the building. If all went well, the report would hopefully be released soon. Departmental spokesperson Popo Maja confirmed that inspectors were going through the entire building, something not done before. Maja stressed that no workers had been forced to work on the 8th floor due to the ceiling problems, but that there was more than enough space elsewhere in the building.
