Corruption Watch (CW) is calling on Parliament’s portfolio committee on Home Affairs to intervene and curb the rampant corruption and maladministration taking place at the Department of Home Affairs’  Desmond Tutu Refugee centre. The non-profit organisation said the state of the centre in Marabastad, Pretoria needed the committee members to discuss the need for urgent steps to be taken. This was important as CW spokesperson, Phemelo Khaas, said the organisation had for many years tried to work with the Department of Home Affairs to resolve the corruption taking place at the centre, to no avail. As of 2015 she said CW had raised their concerns with Home Affairs taking note of the numerous reports of corruption flooding in and system weaknesses aiding this crippling practice to continue thriving. Khaas said the organisations report titled: ‘Project Lokisa: Asylum at a Price,’ identified numerous pitfalls in the departments refugee system, which was allowing for extortion, threats and solicitation from government officials and others. And even with CW’s sting operation resulting in the arrests of two DHA officials and one interpreter, progress of the cases had according to Khaas been slow due to lack of co-operation from the department. This was despite the matters being referred to the Hawks.
