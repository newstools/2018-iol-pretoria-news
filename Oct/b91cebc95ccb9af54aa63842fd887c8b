Patients visiting the Rooihuiskraal clinic in Centurion were this morning educated about breast cancer awareness by City officials and the Pink Drive staff. While some patients had already booked for their mammogram appointment, others were clueless about what was happening at the clinic. But they were soon educated on matters as the group head for health; Koena Nkoko told patients that they were glad to have partnered with the Pink Drive to assist with the breast cancer challenge. “October marks breast cancer awareness month and we are glad to have partnered with Pink Drive because just as mayor Solly Msimanga said: “the government can’t do everything on its own.” “The government cannot afford these services.

"Breast cancer is seen as a women’s problem but it is not, this is a societal problem which needs all of us to work together to create the awareness,” he said. Nkoko told the men at the clinic that they were the best people to detect breast cancer from their partners. He said: “Men are the first people who can detect breast cancer from their partners. "As you cuddle and feel those breasts you can actually feel the lump and be the one to tell your partner to go and get checked at the clinic.” Pink Drive’s Antoinette Joubert gave tips to women on how to perform breast checks on themselves saying early detection of breast cancer saves lives. The Pink Drive mobile breast check truck is currently parked at the venue.
