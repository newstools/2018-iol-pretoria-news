JAMES MAHLOKWANE Hundreds of people found themselves waiting outside the Pretoria Magistrate's Court after a blackout forced security guards to secure the court. The crowd that waited on both sides of Francis Baard Street included court employees, lawyers, victims of crime and out-on-bail suspects and supporters. A security official told the crowd to remain outside as technicians were trying to fix the problems which are delaying justice and court proceedings. The blackout did not affect traffic lights at the nearby busy intersection with Sophie de Bruyn. However, the people were determined to have their day in court and have since opened umbrellas and waited. It is not yet clear what could have caused the blackout but with all the black suits outside the court, the street looks blacker than the pitch black court building. The media formed part of the waiting crowd as former head of crime intelligence in the Free State, Agnes Makhele, was expected to appear for the role she allegedly played in protecting former Acting National Police Commissioner, Khomotso Phahlane. Another big case that is affected is the appearance of the trio accused of murdering a Bronkhorstspruit Court Magistrate last December. Fortunately chief prosecutor in the National Prosecuting Authority, Matric Lupondo, informed media that the appearance was moved to Thursday. However, this appearance was not moved due to the blackout but due to the absence of one legal representative. Sharon Dube said the blackout was an inconvenience because she took leave from work to be in court today to support her cousin who was expected to apply for bail today. A few people started leaving but the majority of the crowd remained behind as they wanted to have their day in court.
