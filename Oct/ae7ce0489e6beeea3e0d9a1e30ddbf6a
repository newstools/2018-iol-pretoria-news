THE Pretoria Magistrate's Court this morning released four metered taxi drivers who were arrested for allegedly robbing and kidnapping a Taxify driver at the Bosman Street Station. The drivers apologised and convinced the Taxify driver to settle the matter peacefully to bring about peace in the industry. Justice Magagane, 52, Vincent Mafhalane, 41, France Ntsane, 55, and McDonald Mapulana, 24, were processed and allowed to go back to their families after weeks in police custody. Mafhalane in fact fainted in court last week when they appeared for the first time to face charges, a few days after being arrested. Gauteng chairperson for metered taxi operators Hendrick Ndou had explained that his colleagues were wrongfully accused, claiming they fined the taxify driver and did not rob. Defence for the four accused Gift Tinyiko Harris said the Taxify driver was a good man who wanted an end to the tension and had no ambition of seeing his clients prosecuted. Harris said he helped orchestrate a mediation process between the drivers to see that the Taxify driver received compensation for his troubles. “Both parties agreed to mediate and to say there must be peace and moving forward they must find a way to work together. Both parties are aggrieved they keep losing friends, family members and businesses partners from all this violence. “The police are looking to involve Minister Blade Nzimande to say he needs to come in and regulate these associations to co-exist. "The state believed the violence will cease because we’ve had numerous meetings with the metered drivers, they want to work in peace,” said Harris.
