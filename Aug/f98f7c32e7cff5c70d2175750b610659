DESPITE a R30 million injection on bulking up the City’s Cable Theft Unit, efforts to stem cable theft that is costing the City millions year on year continue to be a headsore. This was evidenced as the city once more reported, that parts of Soshanguve and Orchards were experiencing power failure due to cable theft. The release indicated that Orchards extensions 46, 47, 84, 88, 90, 91 and 99 were plunged into darkness following an incident of cable theft at the Rosslyn substation. And that in a separate incident, cables were stolen between Soshanguve and Rietgat substations which affected Block  P, R, Y, T, V, SS, KK and the Buffer Zone in Soshanguve. City spokesperson, Lindela Mashigo, said the City’s technicians were already on site attending to both incidents and it was estimated that the power supply would be restored by the evening. The latest setback occurs just days after executive mayor, Solly Msimanga, unveiled the Tshwane metro police departments fleet of 103 off-road vehicles, worth R30 million, as part of the Cable Theft Unit. During the launch it was announced how the vehicles would be on 24-hour patrol in addition to the city adding a 1000 more security guards to man substations across the city.
