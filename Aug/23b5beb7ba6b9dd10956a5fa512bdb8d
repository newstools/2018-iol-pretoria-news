Brra Thabiso, real name Thabiso Mthimunye, who hails from Mabopane, started comedy in 2007 when he spontaneously climbed on stage during a comedy show at Morula Sun. He has naturally found fame by posting parody videos portraying the state of current affairs in South Africa. Almost all of Mthimunye’s videos which he posted on social media have more than 20000 views, some going to 500000. Mthimunye shot his one-man DVD, Puo Phaa, in which he performed his jokes in English and Tswana. He added that he was lured into shooting online skits with his phone because he was not getting gigs. “People did not know me as much as they do now. The social media videos have really helped me in becoming an overnight success and one of the most sought-after comedians to come from Tshwane,” he said. For his fresh style of comedy and his videos, the creative funny man has been nominated for the Savannah Comic Choice Awards under the category of Best Newcomer. Speaking about the nomination, the comic said it was an honour for him to get such recognition. “You know when you are nominated for the Comic Choice Awards, even if you don’t win, it’s like an induction into the big league of comedy. If I win it, even my rates will go up, lol.” Mthimunye said in celebrating his new-found online fame and the nomination, he would be hosting the Fill Up Dinoko Comedy Show on September 7 in Mabopane. He said at Fill Up Dinoko, people would expect to see more of him way better than the videos - plus he has roped in fellow comedians with whom he has created a working relationship over the years. They include Mashabela Galane, Salesman, Sammy Fever and Thapelo KingflatMametja.
