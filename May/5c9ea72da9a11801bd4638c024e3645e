The surprise was not that the show did not deserve it, but the kind of competition it was up against - including the huge hit Wicked. Now the show is on in South Africa, presented by VR Theatrical and Kosie Smit and directed and choreographed by Timothy le Roux. When one sees the promotional material it may seem to be a kids’ puppet show, something like Takalani Sesame, but it’s not: it is described as a comedy musical that tells the story of a college graduate who moves into a shabby flat in New York’s Avenue Q. Using puppets, the story broaches hard issues, as it tells of how Princeton and his friends struggle to find jobs, dates and purpose in life. Le Roux said: “The all-South African cast were put through their paces at auditions late last year. In musical theatre jargon, the term ‘triple threat’ is often used to describe a person who is good at acting, singing and dancing. “What makes this piece of theatre unique is that it includes all that - plus puppetry skills, which require intensive training for our actors.” The cast features stellar performers: Ashleigh Harvey as Kate Monster/Lucy, Clive Gilson as Princeton/Rod, Daniel Geddes as Nicky/Trekkie Monster, Grant Towers as Brian, Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri as Gary Coleman, Rebecca Hartle as Christmas Eve, Nieke Lombard as Bad Idea Bear and Graeme Wicks as Bad Idea Bear. Songezo Khumalo will fill various understudy roles. Actors operate the puppets in full view of the audience, using both their hands while singing, acting and dancing. Asked if it is suitable for children, the general guide is no under-5s and the rest depends on discretion and your sense of your teenagers’ maturity level. The show is on at Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre from Wednesdays to Saturdays at 8, on Saturdays at 4pm and on Sundays at 3pm. Tickets cost R100-R350 at Computicket. A Pretoria News reader can win a double set of tickets for the show (date depending on availability). To enter  text PTANews, AvenueQ to 45607.
