SAKHILE NDLAZI The Military Ombud, Retired Lieutenant-General Temba Matanzima, met strategic stakeholders at the Military Ombud Symposium held under the theme: "Enhancing the role of Military Ombud in keeping the armed forces accountable” yesterday at the Velmore Hotel in Erasmia. Speaking to delegates Matanzima said in the past six years since the office was established they have witnessed a lot of transgression by some members of the Department of Defence, when it came to the application of policies, that disadvantage other soldiers. The office of the Military Ombud was established to investigate and ensure that complaints against the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) are resolved in a fair, economical and efficient manner. The Office of the Military Ombud is entrusted with the responsibility of investigating complaints brought by members of the SANDF who are not satisfied with their conditions of service. The office also investigates complaints brought by members of the public against the official conduct of SANDF personnel. “The last six years in office have been hectic but rewarding in a sense that I was able to work with my investigators and submit findings and recommendations of the complains to the Minster of Defence which were accepted without hassle,” he said. Matanzima said a lot of complaints they had received over years have been to do with promotions, termination of service, lack of 
career management, transfers, non-compliance with the application of policies, and sometimes tools of the trade. But according to Matanzima it was not all doom and gloom. He said they have seen a reduction in these offences by members who are supposed to apply policies in place. “This was achieved through our recommendations and remedial actions to the Minister of Defence.
