The event will be enhanced by projections of visuals, including an english translation of the Latin text. Pianists Wessel van Wyk and Willem de Beer combine forces to offer the first performance of this transcription to the Gauteng public, and tickets range from R140. It is less a transcription than a reinterpretation of the requiem by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with much to tell listeners about how the early 19th century heard Mozart in general, when the four-hand piano arrangement provided a major source of home performance and enjoyment of large-scale compositions. Having unearthed this arrangement of Mozart’s Requiem, the still-feared-by-aspiring-pianists Carl Czerny, Brooklyn Theatre is taking another exciting step towards educating and entertaining its supporters with something as completely unusual as this. Van Wyk is one of the country’s most prominent classical pianists. He completed his music training in Vienna, won the first prize in the international Bösendorfer Piano Competition before returning to the country to establish himself as one of this country’s most active and versatile musicians. De Beer has won various competitions, including the largest of South Africa’s classical music competitions. He was also the main prize winner and the joint winner of the piano category at Unisa’s 120th Anniversary Bursary Concert in 2014, and the runner-up at the fifth National Piano Competition. He was a finalist in the Stellenbosch International Chamber Music Festival Bursary Competition and during 2016 De Beer competed in the 13th Unisa International Piano Competition.
