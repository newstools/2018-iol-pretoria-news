During the event at the Tshwane SAPS Academy it was evident some families still felt the pain of losing their loved ones. The SAPS reminded society of the sacrifices made by the men and women in blue and showed support to the bereaved children of members who died on duty. Acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Bonang Mgwenya said she knew how this period reminded families of their loved ones lost in the line of duty. Mgwenya said SAPS senior management wanted to engage with families in an informal manner: “I know you have suffered a great deal as a result of a loss of your father or mother, but I want to assure you that we are here as your police family to support you in any way we can. We know you miss them; we also miss them in our organisation,” she said. Acting divisional commissioner Major-General Joyce Motubatse described the officers who died on duty as men and women who led selflessly, officers who were not hesitant to reach out and change the lives of ordinary South Africans. Activities of the day included fun and games for the children, as well as a Christmas lunch. The police used the platform to shed light on festive operations, saying they would ensure everyone spent the period in a safe environment through the annual safe festive season operation crime-fighting campaign. The campaign, Quiet Storm, will focus on aggravated robberies, crimes against women and children, the enhancement of border security, enforcement of liquor and second-hand goods acts and by-laws, as well as road safety.
