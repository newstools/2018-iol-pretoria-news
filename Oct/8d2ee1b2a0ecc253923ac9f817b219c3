The forum taking place in Sharm El Sheikh under the auspices of Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, is one of the largest youth platforms in Africa to discuss pressing issues and challenges. This year, being the centenary of Mandela’s birth, a special invitation has been extended to his daughter Zenani Mandela. The honouring ceremony aims to highlight the example Mandela set for young people regarding the potential of every individual to effect change in their communities, countries, and the world. Three speakers will take part - international climate activist, human rights defender, and change agent Catherine Constantinides; sub-Saharan Africa analyst at Rand Merchant Bank and winner of the JSE Spire Awards in South Africa and Africa investor (Ai) Awards in New York Celeste Fauconnie; and Ezlyn Barends, recognised among the Top 200 Young South Africans and top 20 Inspiring Youth and “Dream Girls Academy” co-founder. Egypt’s Ambassador to South Africa, Sherif Issa, said the WYF allowed the world’s youth to discuss shared interests. Staff Reporter
