Pretoria - DA members were once again refused entry to the Desmond Tutu Refugee Centre in Marabastad on Monday. “We came here earlier this month and you denied us entry and you are doing the same thing today, what are you hiding? What is going on in these buildings?” asked DA spokesperson Anneke Skeepers. Skeepers and Abel Tau wanted to conduct an oversight inspection following allegations of corrupt officials exploiting vulnerable asylum seekers by taking bribes in order to secure assistance from the department. But their mission was cut short when security guards denied them entry explaining that the centre manager and supervisor were not available to allow them in.

They said however, before they attempted to conduct their oversight inspection they met with the investigating unit and the counter corruption unit at the Department of Home Affairs to follow up on allegations of corruption taking place at the centre. “We were informed that the situation here has improved as we were told that the gentleman who refused us entry and who has accused of soliciting bribes has been deployed to the ministry as investigations continue. “We are concerned that we are not allowed access here yet again to see what is going on and if things have indeed improved,” Skeepers said. Earlier this month, the DA Gauteng Leader, John Moodey was also refused entrance at the centre.
