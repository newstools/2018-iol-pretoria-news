Earlier this year at the South African Stroke Play Championship at Pecanwood Country Club, Saulez finished second with a score of 26 under par. That vaulted him to second in the GolfRSA rankings, and first in the SA Golf Digest rankings. Another definite highlight for Saulez was qualifying for the SA Open at Glendower, having to eagle the last hole of qualifying and then beating four other players in a play-off for a spot in the tournament. He then made the cut in the SA Open. He also had excellent results in the UK as part of the GolfRSA tour, highlighted by a seventh-place finish in the Irish Amateur Tournament and a fourth place in the British Amateur Championships stroke play qualifier. Last year he was also very consistent, playing golf in eight countries. A highlight was a streak of five consecutive tournaments in which he finished in the top three. He credits his coaches at TuksGolf for his success. “One of the best decisions I ever made was coming to TuksGolf, as the coaches make a point of getting to find out what every player is about, and once they know there is a plan in place to improve any fault in one's technique. “My golf swing especially has matured a great deal under the guidance of Llewellyn van Leeuwen and his team.” It should be no surprise that he was selected for the South African team that is going to contest the Eisenhower Trophy, considered the pinnacle of the amateur game. His teammates are Jovan Rebula and Wilco Nienaber. Saulez started playing golf when he was eight, but it was not the only sport he excelled in. He was also an avid cricket, rugby, hockey and tennis player. He played provincial cricket as a junior. In his matric year at Michaelhouse, his peers voted him the best all-round sportsman at his school. - African News Agency (ANA)
