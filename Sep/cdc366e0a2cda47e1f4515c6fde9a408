Academic activities meanwhile remained suspended because of the violence that erupted at the weekend. Students at both the Soshanguve North and South campuses were sitting around, while some were seen on campus with their bags. A public order police truck had parked outside the North campus entrance. Police officers were roaming the campus. South African Students Congress president Katlego Makgobole said: “Students are fighting with bouncers. Management has brought in so many bouncers, and the SRC decided to use this opportunity to address and resolve important issues such as residential and financial aid. Bringing in too many bouncers does not help; instead the money could be spent somewhere else.” Makgobole said bringing in bouncers was a waste of money, so they were pleading with management to have a sit-down with the SRC on the matter. He said the disruptions were not linked to the death of student Katlego Monareng who was allegedly shot by police during the dispute that followed the SRC elections. TUT management said academic activities would remain suspended until further notice. “TUT management this morning resolved that academic activities will remain suspended until further notice,” said spokesperson Willa de Ruyter. Meanwhile, a task team will look into the alleged election irregularities.
