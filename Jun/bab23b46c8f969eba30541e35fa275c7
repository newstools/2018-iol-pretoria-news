A case of attempted murder has been opened and investigations are underway following a shooting at a taxi rank in Diepsloot which left two people wounded, police have said. The victims, believed to be a taxi owner and a queue marshal were rushed to Tembisa Hospital for medical attention. It is believed that two taxi associations, Alexandra Taxi Association (ATA) and Randburg United Local and Long Distance Taxi Association (RULLDTA) have been at loggerheads for months over routes. Police are closely monitoring the situation and calm has temporarily been restored. Diepsloot police station spokesperson Captain Tinyiko Mathebula said: “At about 5:15am this morning two people were shot and wounded at a taxi rank. One of the people shot is alleged to be a taxi owner and the other is a queue marshal.” “A group of what seemed like taxi drivers drove away in a taxi to the other taxi rank. One person has so far been arrested,” Mathebula said. Commuters were left stranded as there was no alternative transport to take them to work. Lethabo Nkuna, 26, who works in Pretoria central was among the many who could go to work this morning. “I heard gunshots at around 5am but I didn't think it was at the taxi rank. "I was supposed to be at work at 7:30am but here I am; still in Diepsloot. "I just have to call them at work to let them know that I won't be coming since I don't have alternative transport,” she said. Pretoria News
