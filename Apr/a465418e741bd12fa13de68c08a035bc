The Royal Thai embassy in Pretoria celebrated and welcomed the new year with their first Songkran festival at the embassy’s offices in Hatfield. Thai food, dancing, indigenous plants, teas, flowers and fruits were the order of the day. It was also a colourful spectacle of Thai nationals dressed in decorative regalia; masseuses were on call and music filled the air, with children running around with water guns and the older groups could also be seen pouring cups of water all over each with. First Secretary for the embassy Kanok Phuaknuem, said the festival was celebrated as it represented an important item on the calendar for the over 4000-strong Thai community in the country. But it also held significance as it represented the 25th anniversary of South Africa's relationship with Thailand. Phuaknuem said that in Thailand, people celebrated the event by throwing water on each other, but there was a deeper meaning to it. Water marks the passing of the new year, and it is used to purify and mark a new beginning, he said. “Other people would go to a temple to offer scented water to the religious statues, but also offer it to someone they respect. In this way it is cleansing them and asking for good luck.” Bruno Dindelo, who was at the event, said being exposed to other cultures was something that was an eye-opener for anyone. “You don’t have to go all the way to another country or continent to experience other people’s culture. And once you take the time to learn other people’s cultures you really get to see how similar all human beings are,” he said. Dindelo however said his favourite part of the festival by far was the slimming tea and Thai massages.
