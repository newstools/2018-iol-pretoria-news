Pretoria - Former acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is expected to hand himself over to authorities on Thursday morning to face charges of corruption.
 
Phahlane’s wife Beauty Ntombizowda Phahlane, who is a police officer, will also be handing herself over along with businessman Durand Synman. The three will be facing corruption charges laid by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).
 
They will appear at the Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Thursday, News24 reports.
 
Ipid alleges that police supplier Keith Keating who owns Forensic Data Analyst (FDA) facilitated the payment for the cars for Phahlane through the dealership owned by Synman.
 
The Hawks last year raided properties belonging to Phahlane and Keating.
 
Keating is accused of gifting Phahlane with expensive cars in return for favours. But Phahlane, who was the head of forensic at the time of the alleged dealings, has denied any corrupt deals and claims the cars were part of a sponsorship.
 
The charges the three face include; money laundering, corruption and fraud.  
 
Some of the cars the couple received include a Landrover Discovery, Nissan Navarra, Toyota Hilux, Grey Merc, Silver VW and a Ford Rover.
 
Keating, like Phahlane, denies any corrupt dealings and claimed Phahlane did not get his cars from him. Political Bureau
