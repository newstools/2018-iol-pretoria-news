The group had between five and six men, and was chased from the park by the patrolling police officers at about 3am on Monday. The wildlife park is still reeling from shock after the death of its six lions from poisoning, They were found decapitated and with their paws cut off. Hi-Risk Unit Security spokesperson Arthur Crew said they did not know if the trespassers were the same crew who attacked the lions on Saturday. He said, however, that perpetrators were not known to return to the scene of the crime. “We have not made any arrest, but we are following a good lead,” he said. Park owner Christa Saayman said the poachers who committed the crime needed to be strongly dealt with to send a strong message. “Some are repeat offenders. They were arrested and treated gently for committing horrible crimes to animals. “Some kill these animals just to sell their heads and paws for muti. That's rubbish; you can't make any working muti from these poor animals. “I’m considering closing the park because I am putting my life and that of my family at risk. This is a very difficult situation to find yourself in as a lover of wild animals. “You think about putting the animals in a safer enclosure, but that is a very expensive task. “Anyway, that enclosure can still be broken into as these criminals are dedicated.” Saayman said she would appreciate support to have two armed security officers watching over the animals for 24 hours or at night. She also encouraged South Africans to start creating awareness and to educate children to love and protect all wild animals. Saayman said the park lost two rhinos 10 years ago. The rhinos had been shot and killed for their horns. “People who buy or sell any part of the body of a wild animal as muti are creating a market for killers,” she added. Pretoria News
