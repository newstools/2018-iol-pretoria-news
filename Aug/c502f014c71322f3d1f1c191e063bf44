State prosecutor Yusuf Baba said on Monday that Momberg was granted leave to appeal in the high court. “The State will not be opposing bail.” Baba said one of the reasons the State would not be opposing bail was because Momberg had spent four months in prison and would be legible for parole in about two months. He added that she was not considered a flight risk. In March, Momberg was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison with one year suspended and was previously denied leave to appeal. Before proceeding, Kingdom Onah, for Momberg, requested that she be unshackled as it was against her constitutional rights. In 2016, Momberg was caught on camera using the k-word 48 times in an encounter with a police officer who was trying to help her after she was involved in an alleged smash-and-grab incident. Onah told the court the former estate agent, 49, had no source of income and her parents were pensioners. “The defence had spoken to her family and friends and they were able to raise R2000.” Onah said by agreement with the State he would be able to return to court for an update on the appeal on November 5. Momberg said through Onah that if there were conditions, she requested to be allowed to travel to Durban. Magistrate Pravina Raghoonandan granted Momberg R2000 bail pending finalisation of the appeal of her sentence and conviction. The matter was postponed to November 5. - African News Agency (ANA)
