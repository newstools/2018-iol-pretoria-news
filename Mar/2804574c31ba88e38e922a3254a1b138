KaMagwaza-Msibi is set to continue leading her party when it holds an elective conference. Yesterday the NFP president paid a surprise visit to the Independent Media offices in Durban. The Deputy Science and Technology Minister’s speech was still not clear, and she depended on a walking stick. One of her assistants kept using a paper to blow fresh air into her face. Asked for a one-on-one interview, party secretary-general Nhlanhla Khubisa offered to speak on her behalf. “She is well, as you can see she is fine and she is still active in her department." Khubisa said that for the voter registration campaign kaMagwaza-Msibi visited IFP and NFP strongholds in KZN. “The reception was good.” The seven-year-old NFP has on several occasions postponed its national conference to elect new leadership. Khubisa said that since she was recovering kaMagwaza-Msibi was making sure this happens within six months. She would retain her position without having a contestant during the conference as “this is enshrined in our constitution”.
