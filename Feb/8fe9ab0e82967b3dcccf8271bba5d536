Well an evening of magical music and stories with Chris de Burgh at the Time Square Sun Arena. The 65-year-old last performed in South Africa in 2016, charming the audience by dancing with several fans to his evergreen hit, Lady in Red. Songs like Just Another Poor Boy, Don’t Pay the Ferryman, A Spaceman Came Travelling and his other show-stopping hits have made him a household name. His latest offering, A Better World, will certainly make music lovers revel in their seats. Always in tune with global and political issues, De Burgh provides much food for thought in the lyrical content of his new album. The title alone sets the tone and intent for a collection of songs which, although not exclusively concerned with key issues of the day, certainly holds up a mirror to many of them. Elsewhere on A Better World, De Burgh crafted material that addresses many of the themes and topics which have so richly and uniquely coloured his musical agenda; love, war and adventure, travel, discovery and homecoming, the past, the present - and the future. The songs offer a clear insight into the thinking and imagination of one of popular music’s most evocative and accomplished songwriters, whose long and consistent career has so far resulted in sales of 50million albums and sold-out performances in concert halls worldwide. Musically, A Better World is a familiar De Burgh melting pot of diverse styles, tempos and instrumentation. It all comes together to continue and enhance the unique musical footprint which Chris has created for himself while composing a career-long repertoire of more than 280 songs. He will be at Sun Arena, Time Square on March 2, and ticket prices range from R460 to R800 at Big Concerts and 
Computicket.
