As the country celebrates Women's Month, the Pretoria News caught up with Pretoria's very own much-loved vlogger, comedian and professional chef, Lebogang Tlokana, 28, who has more than 130000 followers on Facebook and more than 75000 on Twitter. She rose to fame after uploading a video titled: “If The R14million Was Received By a Pretoria Girl.” In the video she portrays many characters, mimicking the recipient of the money, Sibongile Mani from Durban. Mani is the Walter Sisulu University student who spent more than R800000 after millions were mistakenly deposited into her account. After that video, Tlokana created a Twitter account, which gained over 10000 followers in one week. The Funny Chef began doing comedy skits in 2010. Her videos, mostly creating humour about what's trending, always get tongues wagging on social media. “Life creates those jokes for me. An ordinary day can create wonderful material, from the hood to the burbs. “There's just always something to make fun out of,” she said. Tlokana said realising that she made people happy was what it took her to be where she is today. “When I realised I make people happy I would always try to make people laugh without trying, or try to improve a friend's mood by joking around or acting stupid but funny enough it always worked. I knew I was meant to be a comedian right there.” She has done many gigs, which she says are her biggest career highlights so far. “The gigs, my God the gigs! I’ve been so busy ever since The Funny Chef Became a brand, it's amazing.” Tlokana also shared her plans for the rest of the year - and keeping the city flag flying high is one of them. “I've got five more gigs, I want to make money, and to take a minute to enjoy what God gave me. “I've been busy but I don't remember being still and embracing how far I've gotten.”
