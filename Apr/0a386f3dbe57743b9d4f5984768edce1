Instead, he received a backlash for performing in Israel even though there is a cultural boycott over the occupation of Palestine. The DJ, born Nkosinathi Maphumulo, claimed in a tweet he was unaware of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The DJ also said he was in the region because he would do anything to feed his family. In another tweet he said: “Just like everyone else I have rights and free will and no, Black Coffee is not a political party I work as an entertainer to feed my family. To sum it up I will take a bullet for my family.” BDS South Africa has come out and criticised Black Coffee for feigning ignorance because the organisation said it approached him in 2014 before his performance in Tel Aviv. BDS South Africa spokesperson Kwara Kekana said: “Black Coffee is familiar with the issue of the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. "In 2014 Palestine solidarity groups reached out to him before his scheduled performance in Tel-Aviv at the time armed with sufficient information about the issue he chose to cross the picket line 
just like he did this past week. “Artists and cultural institutions that act in violation of the cultural boycott against Israel find themselves complicit in a system of normalising and whitewashing the violations of Palestinian human rights and international law by Israel.” On Twitter Black Coffee was criticised by followers for boycotting Swaziland but performing in Israel even though there is a cultural boycott. In 2011, Black Coffee boycotted a Swaziland concert. He said at the time: “We can’t be happy when Swazi people are suffering. We support the call to boycott the festival. I am not going.”
