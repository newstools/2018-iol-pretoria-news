Represented by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union, workers have been on strike for about a week. The union intensified its picket at the head offices in the past two days, opposing the new data capturing system which workers say could lead to job losses. About 100 workers are on a protected strike and want the system scrapped, claiming they were not consulted about its implementation. Union branch secretary Nkululeko Ntloko said: “The strike action comes as a result of the arrogance and intransigence by the employer in resolving our genuine demands. “The employer has unilaterally implemented the Business Process Engineering, which might lead to a jobs bloodbath at the council. “We are worried about being sidelined during the implementation of these changes that include the introduction of mechanisation and automation of the workplace which might lead to job losses,” he said. Ntloko said the system threatened the jobs of their members who had previously done the work manually. He raised concerns about the lack of transparency and a unilateral decision to shut down work streams without consulting the union. “Management of the organisation has been involved in some processes that were not inclusive to us but the accord is very clear in terms of the process that needs to be done in as far as including all parties so that there is labour peace and there are no issues of unfair labour practices,” he said. “We want management to come to the table. We are not saying they can’t continue with the process, but they must come back to the table and negotiate and see where we can meet each other on this process because the issue that’s worrying the workers is that they are running away from the table,” he said. Ntloko said workers were not willing to resume work until management engaged them . The council posted a notice at the front door saying services were suspended until further notice.
