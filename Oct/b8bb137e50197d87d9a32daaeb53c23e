DIRECTOR of academics at Nova Pioneer, Des Hugo, said anxiety in the run-up to assessments and exams could lead to bad habits. Hugo noted that most pupils cross-nighted in an effort to memorise as much information as possible in a short space of time. “This memorisation technique, based on repetition, is referred to as rote learning and could lead to the reduction of retention and could affect the level of understanding of information. "Therefore low performance in a test doesn’t always mean no studying was done. In some cases, it means a child wasn’t able to fully grasp and understand the information.” Hugo said it was important to understand that pupils had personal preferences and areas of strength for acquiring knowledge. She said the areas could either be through auditory or visual. She said cramming was one of the reasons why pupils failed. Botse-Botse Secondary School principal Mzamani Chauke said pupils need to plan and stay focused when preparing for their exams. Chauke said planning, a self-study timetable and previous study materials were important for pupils to study for exams.
