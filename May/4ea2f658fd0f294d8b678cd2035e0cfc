Co-ordinated by non-profit organisation Heirs of The World, the event saw pupils of Dansa International College, Letlhabile, Stanza Bopape and Mahube Valley secondary schools come together to see who would take top honours. They exchanged ideas and discussed the future of the nation. The aim of the debate tournament was to challenge pupils to think on a critical and practical level pertaining to solutions. The finalists participated in preliminary rounds of intense training and qualification rounds in the two weekends leading up to the finals. The 48 pupils were trained by law students from Unisa in public speaking, voice training, structuring arguments and research on how to substantiate arguments, using the constitution and case laws. The issues debated included land expropriation without compensation, criminalisation of racism and the effectiveness of protests and strikes. Co-ordinator Piet Mabaso said the intention was to break down barriers between privileged and underprivileged schools to enable peers to discuss current affairs. “We were used to giving out materialistic things to people, but thought of doing something that will have an everlasting effect so we decided on a debate tournament to provide pupils with skills. “We wanted to see their thinking skills and create better leaders who have different but common views and gather to find solutions.” Mabaso said the burning topic the pupils were passionate about was the state of basic education. He said it was impressive to see them speak from their hearts about issues they went through at their schools daily, including going around school premises every day looking for a chair to sit on in class. Dansa International College was the overall winner, with its Israel Domingoes receiving the Best Introduction award and Rossy Manana the Best Conclusion and Overall Best Speaker awards. Mahube Valley Secondary School were runners up; its pupil Tinyiko Malatji received the Most Valuable Speaker award.
