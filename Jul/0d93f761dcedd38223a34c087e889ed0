THE South African National Taxi Council has put their backing behind the Department of Social Development’s bid to push social grants through the postal services. This backing was announced following the first consultative meeting between Santaco representatives and the Social Development Minister, Susan Shabangu, in Pretoria. Shabangu said the purpose of the meeting with stakeholders was in line with ensuring that all stakeholders available could be united in order to help the department meet the six month deadline to phase out Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) payment of social grants. “We thought we need to meet with the taxi industry leaders to ensure that when the crunch time comes we are not found not ready to deal with the situation.” "We want to make sure we start talking and addressing some of the issues and possible collaboration especially as some beneficiaries in rural areas do not have transport. Shabangu said teams had been set up to refine processes and make sure the collaboration happens in a smooth way. Santaco president, Phillip Taaibosch , said they were overwhelmed with what was put on the table and glad there was confidence being shown in the taxi industry.
