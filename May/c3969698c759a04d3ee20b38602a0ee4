With the drive, the mother and son team intends to collect as many clothes and food parcels to help the less fortunate by using social media. The drive, titled Di Chomi - or Friends - was initially aimed at benefiting nyaope addicts at Mabopane stations, but it turned into a community initiative when people started donating clothes, Khutsi said. Di Chomi started growing legs after he posted a picture of those he had helped on his Facebook page, he said. “Me and my mom were concerned about how cold it was this year. After we donated clothes to addicts, I started getting messages from my Facebook friends indicating they had items they would like to donate. “We collected the clothes and even got  baby outfits. I then asked my friends if they know any infants we could assist with baby clothes. “I got several inbox messages about babies who had no clothes. It has been a humbling experience because I didn’t know there are so many less fortunate people.” Since the pair started Di Chomi they have been able to dress six  babies aged 0 to 6 months. They also donated clothes to four homes and two child-headed households. In addition, they donated jeans and sneakers to 30 nyaope addicts. According to Pastor Malala, with Di Chomi, donors get to assist people they have never seen before. Di Chomi encourages donors to take a pictures of themselves with their donations. The recipient is also asked to take a picture of receiving the donations, all in the spirit of creating new friendships. “After we have concluded our clothing drive, we intend to do a soup kitchen once a month whereby we will introduce these new friends (donors and recipients) to each other. We already have some who have pledged to assist with funds for the event, but still need more donations or sponsors,” Pastor Malala said.
