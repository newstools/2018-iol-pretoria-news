His supporters are telling one another in Zimbabwe to “brace” themselves for information that he is “never going to get better.” Tsvangirai, 65, is with his family in Joburg and has been here for three months. He deteriorated quite quickly in the last few days and is struggling to breathe. He was operated on for cancer in South Africa in 2016 and has had several rounds of chemotherapy. Tsvangirai, prime minister in Zimbabwe’s inclusive government from 2009 to 2013, recently met President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the first time since he launched the MDC that the governing party has treated him with some courtesy. Under former president Robert Mugabe he was regularly insulted, personally, and massively abused by the state-controlled media and mocked mercilessly by Zanu-PF leaders. Tsvangirai failed to win elections in 2008 when he did not get more then 50% of the vote, but he had easily beaten Mugabe in the first round. During the run-up to the second round, there was so much violence that he pulled out of the poll. It was then that South Africa, under president Thabo Mbeki, began to implement plans for an inclusive government. Tsvangirai went into it even though it was heavily weighted in Mugabe’s favour. He and others in the MDC said they were going into it to “save” the country as all hospitals, schools and supermarkets were either closed or empty as the Zanu-PF administration allowed hyperinflation to wreck the economy. Many believe that Tsvangirai was the bravest of all the post-independence leaders who took on Zanu-PF which made it clear, shortly after independence, it wanted a one-party state. Tsvangirai’s brothers, and his children and his second wife, Elizabeth, are with him in Joburg.
