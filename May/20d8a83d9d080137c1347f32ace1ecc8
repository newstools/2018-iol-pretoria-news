SAKHILE NDLAZI A delegation from Mamelodi Sundowns visited Mamelodi High School earlier today. Sundowns’ reserve team also known as Sundowns MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) encouraged the pupils to support them ahead of the Diski Shield final against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. The Diski Shield tournament has already proved hugely popular with locals. The club that wins the ultimate prize of R150 000 will donate that money towards a community initiative. Mamelodi Sundowns will play for Mamelodi High School and Kaizer Chiefs are playing for Emshukantambo High School based in Soweto.
