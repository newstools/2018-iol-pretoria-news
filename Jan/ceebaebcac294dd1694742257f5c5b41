The resort was abuzz as hundreds of revellers travelled from across Pretoria to gather there to enjoy music, food and drinks under the watchful eye of the metro police. The pools had a lot of children splashing about, jumping in and climbing out and making cheerful noises as they cooled down. As required, they wore floating aids under the watchful eye of their parents. A great many others spent time listening to music from their vehicles, and dancing to the beats. For most, meat was being braaied to celebrate the new year. As is normal on this day, metro police were deployed to provide safety and ensure security.  Joyce Phaswana said: “I decided to bring all my children, nephews and nieces to Fountains because it is affordable. Initially I wanted to take them to the Pretoria Zoo, but Fountains seemed the more affordable choice because I paid only R20 for each child.” She said the children were visiting her Atteridgeville home from Limpopo, and she wanted to make sure they enjoyed themselves in the city before they left to resume their schooling.  Meanwhile, couple Ally Nkosi and Andiswa Nkungwana made sure the area by the pool was filled with the aroma of tasty meat on the braai.  Nkungwana said: “It’s nice being here because you get to relax and the environment is safe. I love it here because everyone minds their own business and everyone is here to be happy and have a good time.” Most of those at the park said they still had a couple of weeks before it was back to work and they intended to make the most of that time. And they would start the year off by enjoying themselves as best they could - relaxing at city spots where they could enjoy the facilities and amenities at a reasonable price. By yesterday afternoon vehicles were still lining up at the entrance as families, friends, colleagues and acquaintances streamed in, with the intention of starting the new year off with a bang.
