This is to ensure people do not drink and become irresponsible during the festive season. Yesterday, Concerned Tshwane Liquor Traders’ Association president Oupa Mthombeni stressed responsible trading for tavern owners. He reminded owners in Mamelodi, who gathered at Emzim Cool Village, about acting in line with the provisions of licences. “The objective of the campaign is to educate our members not to sell alcohol to pregnant women and under-age children,” he said. Mthombeni also told owners to always put customers first, which included monitoring their drinking and ensuring they drank responsibly. “If you see that someone is drinking too much, don’t allow them to drive home. You can request an Uber for them, and that way you will save lives.” Owners were also told about the importance of respect. “You need to respect your neighbours. If you see that your customers are parked in front of people’s gates, it is your responsibility to tell them to move. “Also, this thing of making a noise for neighbours, only for you to snap when they tell you about it, needs to stop,” he reprimanded them. Throughout the year, the association has conducted door-to- door campaigns around city townships, reminding owners about the importance of compliance, as they sought to ensure that traders knew their responsibility in making a living from selling alcohol.
