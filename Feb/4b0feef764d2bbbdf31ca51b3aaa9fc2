Botsane made local triathlon history at the recent Continental Cup meeting in Troutbeck, Zimbabwe, when she raced to a second place finish in her age category. The Grade 10 pupil has also set her sights on winning a medal at the South African Triathlon Championships in Bloemfontein. “I want to prove that anybody can do any sport as long as they are prepared to seriously commit to hard training and not be fazed if they fail at first. It might sound a bit arrogant, but I want to become a role model in female sport. I know a lot of hard work still awaits, but if I can stay focused I think there is a real chance that I can represent South Africa at an Olympic Games.” Botsane is a massive fan of Richard Murray’s exploits in international triathlon events. And it is not only because he proved that with the right attitude the world’s best could be beaten. Murray is also not known for his swimming prowess. It is something he continually needs to work hard at, and the TuksSport High School pupil can relate. At the Continental Cup race, her swimming was not too bad. She was the fourth athlete out of the water. She suffered during the cycling leg. She blames it on the hilly course. But she fought back well during the run to ensure a podium finish. Kate Roberts, a former Olympic triathlete, coaches Botsane. She has been predicting that Botsane could become a trailblazer. “My challenge is to make sure that Tsebo fulfils her real potential. She is hungry to succeed.” - African News Agency (ANA)
