Pretoria streets were painted blue and white with Israeli flags and placards raised high. Hundreds of members of the South Africans Friends of Israel, political parties and Christian groups among others dedicated their day to march and deliver their petition at the Union Buildings and also pray for the South African government to have good relations with Israel. Protesters waved their placards high and unlike other marches where protesters sing struggle songs, these ones are singing hymns and gospel songs. "Not in God's name", "Send SA ambassador back to Israel", "No to downgrade" and "I will bless those who bless you and curse him that curses" are some of the messages written on the placards. The March has seen support from Cope President, Mosiuoa Lakota, President of the African Christian Democratic Party, Kenneth Meshoe and Chief Phakama Shembe.

The march and prayer gathering comes after the country recalled the SA ambassador from Israel as a result of the killings of Palestinians at the Gaza border in May. Meshoe said he was there to make the ANC know that they had made a big mistake by allowing the downgrade of the South African embassy in Israel to happen. He said the majority of people at the march are Christians and if the government does not listen to their demands then they must not plead with them for votes. "If the ANC doesn't listen to us it means they are undermining Christians and they shouldn't expect votes from us next year," he said. The petition has over 40 000 signatures. Pretoria News
