The defending champions will be fielding a whole new team. Senior Tuks players are representing the Jaguars at the SuperClub Tournament in New Zealand. UP-Tuks head coach Jenny van Dyk is also coaching the Jaguars. She and her coaching staff had to plan their campaign for the two tournaments to the finest detail. In the absence of Van Dyk, Erin Burger has been coaching the team of eight players - half of whom have never played Varsity netball - to take on Kovsies. On Sunday Van Dyk and four senior players will be travelling to Bloemfontein to play if needed on Monday against North-West Pukke. “Yes the players are slightly nervous, but it will get the adrenalin going,” said Burger. Kovsies are formidable, she said, as the core of the team represented the Crinums in the Brutal Fruit Series, so they’re settled as combinations. “We’ll be the underdogs. But I’m confident the team will give a good account of themselves.” The UP-Tuks team against Kovsies and North-West Pukke : Venetia Grobler, Rumandi Potgieter, Anique Grobler, Andile Tombeni, Jeanette Vermeulen, Marilyn Cilengi, Lebogang Kekana, Juzelri Garbers, Ine-Mari Venter, Chantelle Swart, Tshina Mdau, Akosua Mensah. - African News Agency (ANA)
