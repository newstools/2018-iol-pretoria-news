This morning, A Re Yeng buses in the area are under the watch of Metro Police officers, who should be enforcing municipal by-laws elsewhere. The action has to be taken because the hooligans threatened to torch the buses, the source of “anger” about the fact that the buses are always overcrowded. This is the community that is so organised that it even has a forum that looks after the welfare of those who use public transport. In a normal environment, a delegation from that forum should be sent to the bus operator to ask for more buses. Think of instances when there are taxi strikes, as well the citywide ANC unrest ahead of the local government polls in 2016; there were more buses burnt to ashes in Mamelodi than in other parts of the city. Mamelodi residents are building up a reputation that when they are unhappy, buses have to pay the ultimate price. The City of Tshwane did well by suspending the bus service yesterday and subsequently plans how the situation will be managed. In the first place, the municipality did not have to provide a bus service to the area. When the route was first ditched by Putco and later Autopax, the City stepped in and serviced the route that is the responsibility of the provincial government. The least Mamelodi people can do is appreciate this gesture. Come on, Mamelodi folk; you have much more to offer Tshwane and the nation at large than burning buses. - Kennedy Mudzuli
