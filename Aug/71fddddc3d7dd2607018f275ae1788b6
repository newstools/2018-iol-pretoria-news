Pretoria - Deputy Minister of Small Business Development Cassel Mathale handed over tools and equipment to 240 informal traders from Tshwane townships this morning. The department had given the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) a mandate to implement a Micro Enterprise Development Programme (IMEDP) to assist these beneficiaries. IMEPD provided the qualifying entrepreneurs with basic business management training and a 100% grant for the acquisition of the basic equipment and tools. Mathale said beneficiaries were put on Seda's database after showing interest in growing their businesses. They needed government support to excel and grow their businesses and the department extended its helping hand. The beneficiaries are still gathering on open ground near the Department of Trade and Industry in the City to collect equipment like fridges, printers, laptops, sewing machines and other essentials. The programme was previously implemented by the Department of Small Business Development but is now delivered through Sedaâ€™s network of 54 branches across all nine South African provinces. Frans Mabaso from Ga-Rankuwa said he was proud to receive a fridge to assist in his spaza shop and hoped the department could do the same for other people. "All these things we are receiving will go a long way in assisting our businesses. "I have being running a spaza shop since the 1990s and this is the first time I have received this kind of generous support. I thank all involved parties," he said. Pretoria News
