Ramaphosa is on a visit to the powerful oil-producing nations as part of a drive to raise $100bn to revitalise the economy. Today Ramaphosa, accompanied by Police Minister Bheki Cele, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, meets Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the deputy commander of the UAE's armed forces. The UAE is a growing export market for South African products and the trade between the two stood at R23,2bn in 2017. Ramaphosa was in Jeddah, the kingdom's commercial capital, on a state visit to strengthen economic relations with the Middle East powerhouse. South Africa imports about 47% of its oil from Saudi Arabia and the kingdom is also a large investor in the country in renewable energy. Total trade between South Africa and Saudi Arabia amounted to just more than R55bn in 2017. Radebe said they had signed a R12bn deal on renewable energy with Red Stone and Aqua, which is a Saudi energy company. Saudi Arabia would also support South Africa’s interest in having an observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation (OIC). Anil Sooklal, the Department of International Relations' deputy director-general on Asia, said Saudi Arabia was a key player in the Arab and Islamic world. "Saudi Arabia is one of the most influential countries in the Islamic world. "Securing the support of Saudi Arabia is critical," he said. Ramaphosa also met Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, who accompanied the government ministers.
