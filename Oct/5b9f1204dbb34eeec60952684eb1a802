The group is closing off its year-long tour with a one-night-only performance in the city. They will be performing songs from their latest album Joyous Celebration 22. Co-founder and conductor Lindelani Mkhize said the show would be something never experienced before. “The show will be a power-packed production featuring guest appearances by some of our fans’ all-time favourite members who graced our stage in the past. “We have also enlisted spiritual leaders to offer our thanksgiving for the extended Joyous family as a whole,” he said. Gospel Silinda said with this being the last show of their tour, they would be bringing their best. “Not only will we be closing the tour, but we will also be preparing people for the next recording; so people must expect the best of the best. “I love to dance and on the night I will be pouring my heart out.” Silinda said the music was more about ministry than just dancing, and people must expect to be healed through performances on the night. The tour has already been to Joburg, Cape Town, Durban, Mpumalanga, Bloemfontein and Botswana. Founding member Pastor Jabu Hlongwane said it was humbling that even after 22 years in the industry, they continued receiving a positive response from people during the tour.
