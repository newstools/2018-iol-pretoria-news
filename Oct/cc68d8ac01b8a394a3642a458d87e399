National Nutrition Week will be observed from today to October 15. National Obesity Week is from October 15 to 19. It was announced that, for the first time, a broad coalition of health partners will promote a shared message that eating breakfast is the best way to start the day. They will also encourage people to get into the habit of having breakfast every day. The participants include the national and provincial departments of Health, Department of Basic Education, South African Military Health Services, the Association for Dietetics in South Africa, the Cancer Association of South Africa, the Nutrition Society of South Africa, the Heart and Stroke Foundation SA, the Consumer Education Project of Milk South Africa and the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa. During the two-week awareness campaign, the nine partners will encourage a healthy balanced breakfast as well as drinking water instead of sugary drinks. According to the World Health Organisation, a healthy diet helps protect against malnutrition in all its forms, prevents non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer. The partners agree that eating breakfast daily has many health benefits. Planning for breakfast - from drawing up meal plans and a food budget to shopping for affordable, healthy options and preparing the meal the night before can help to avoid breakfast becoming a hassle to make the next morning. The Heart and Stroke Foundation SA said a healthy breakfast kick-starts the metabolism. The first meal of the day boosted mental functioning and physical energy on a day-to-day basis.
