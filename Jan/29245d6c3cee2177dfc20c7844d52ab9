The purpose was for his plea and trial, after his opposition to prosecution was ultimately turned down. However, the matter was postponed to January 31 and his bail extended. Kevin was wearing the same shirt he wore when he was arrested on August 11 after he allegedly spat on Brian Silinda Zindonga at the school. He was released on a R1 000 bail on charges of crimen injuria and another of assault. Zindonga, who was not present in court on Thursday, alleged that the 19-year-old who was a matric pupil at the time of the incident, openly blew his nose and threw the used tissue at him. He then said “black man, pick up”, according to Zindonga. When he was confronted by staff at the school, Kevin allegedly spat in Zindonga’s face. After the matter was postponed, Kevin exited the court with his lawyer and an unidentified man by his side. Pretoria News
