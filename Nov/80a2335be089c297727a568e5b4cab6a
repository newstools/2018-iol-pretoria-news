Pretoria - Laudium Primary School teachers came out to criticise their male colleague who caused a social media stir when he publicly called the school principal racist and disrespectful for saying his traditional Swati attire was “inappropriate” on Thursday. The educators who were predominantly female and represented various demographic groups said Mlandvo Dlamini misled the public by covering himself up before taking a video he published on social media in which he criticised the school head. Speaking to the Pretoria News, the educators said they were disappointed by Dlamini’s conduct but worst of all they were embarrassed and offended about how he was actually dressed before taking the photos and videos he published. They said his initial regalia did not have the purple towel or sheet he wore underneath and everyone at the school could see his upper thigh and red underwear. Dlamini took the issue to Instagram and Twitter and received messages of support from people who thought his attire was more than acceptable. However, the educators said they were hurt because the public did not get a clear perspective of what truly transpired. The educators said they were compelled to speak out on the matter not to retaliate but to correct Dlamini and enlighten the public since they believed that everyone, including investigators from the department were mislead.
