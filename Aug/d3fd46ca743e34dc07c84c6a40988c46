Fears that the country was about to witness another Life Esidimeni following allegations of patient mismanagement and violations at the Tower Psychiatric hospital and Psychosocial rehabilitation centre are nothing more than fabricated lies. This was detailed by Health Ombud, Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, as he revealed the results of his report at the Office of Health Standards Compliance offices in Pretoria. The investigations and subsequent report by the ombud was sparked after media reports surfaced on March 4, alleging gross human rights violations were taking place at the centre in Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape. The media reports were according to Makgoba, brought to the fore by head of psychiatry at the centre, Dr Kiran Sukeri.

He also added that all stakeholders were of the view there were no other "degrading and inhumane treatments" observed or found as alleged by Dr. Sukeri. News reports and allegations by Dr Sukeri that there had been 90 deaths at the centre were also found to have been false. “Over an 8year period, 68 mental health patients had died at the hospital and not the falsified and exaggerated total of 90 deaths as reported in the media with Dr Sukeri’s collaboration.”
