Through his company, Rudzambilu Holdings, he initiated an awareness campaign for disabled people at Soshanguve Crossing mall at the weekend. Themed, Set it up, the awareness campaign tried to minimise communication barriers and strengthen the relationship between people living with disabilities and their able-bodied counterparts. The outreach session was also to conscientise the community about people living with disabilities. “Both of my parents were totally deaf, so I realised the struggles, which is why I came up with this project,” Netshidzati said. “We realised there was a big gap in terms of how people with disabilities interact with each other, we wanted to create a space where they can voice their daily struggles and challenges to the public and to each other.” Netshidzati said he wanted the community of Soshanguve to learn sign language. “We are here to wipe out the mentality that the disabled are not able to do certain things; and to strengthen the relation between the community and disabled people so they help each other.” Wheelchair-bound Samkelisiwe Ntshangase, who is in Grade 12 at Filadelfia Secondary School, said she wanted the public to stop pitying them. “This is the perfect opportunity to let people know how we feel. We also want to be part of society. For example in townships we don’t have many special schools and have to travel to town to get decent education.” She and a group of friends started a campaign at school titled, Going inclusive, last year to get rid of the stigma around disability and root out the mindset  that the disabled were cursed. Educators at the event assured the young people that while their bodies could be disabled, their minds were not.
