The organisers said the occasion marked an expression of the diversity of the Cuban culture and heritage. One could discern a sense of patriotism from the Cubans as they sang together the most famous song in their country, Guantanamera, from 1929. Apart from the singing the occasion was also characterised by a display of ballet, which was a big part of Cuban culture, according to their ambassador in South Africa, Rodolfo Benítez Verson. “This is a special day for Cuba and for all people born in Cuba. In Cuba you can’t separate nation and culture. “For us it is an indivisible concept,” he said. He said the occasion gave the Cubans an opportunity to celebrate their African roots. “The presence of Africa is very strong in Cuba. We are a Latin American country. We are so happy to have so many friends of Cuba in South Africa celebrating together the Cuban culture and Cuba revolution,” Verson said. The event was also used to honour people who have contributed to their culture in South Africa. Verson said those honoured had for many years imparted the Cuban way of ballet to locals. “We are also sharing with our friends typical Cuban food. The main component of that food is pork. “You cannot have a big celebration in Cuba without having pork on the table. We are also offering a mixture of brown rice and black beans,” he said.
