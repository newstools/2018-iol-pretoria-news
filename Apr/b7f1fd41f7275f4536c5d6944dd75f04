Manyonga produced a sixth and final jump of 8.41metres to send the previous mark of 8.34m, set by Australian Henry Frayne during the qualifying round on Tuesday, to the history books. Despite the record leap, the man who grew up in Paarl in the Western Cape, was always in control in posting a fourth jump of 8.35m to ease to the front in the event. Frayne took silver with a 8.24m jump, and another South African, Ruswahl Samaai, finishing third at 8.22m and scooping the bronze for his efforts. There was more good news for Team SA on the shot-put scene as Reinhardt Hamman recorded a season-best throw of 13.15m to claim the bronze medal. The other South African in the competition, Juarne Jenkinson, ended eighth with a best on the night of 9.63m. Gold went to Australian Carmen Crombie with an evening best of 15.74 on count-back, with countryman Marty Jackson recording the same distance but ending with 
silver. At the end of the seventh day, Team SA's medal tally stood at 25, comprising 10 gold, six silver and nine bronze. See Page 22 and Sport
