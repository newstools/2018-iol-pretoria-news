Post Office employees represented by three unions intensified their call for a living wage and have downed tools at the Tshwane Mail Centre for the past three days. Employees are also striking over working conditions. There is debris from burnt tyres outside the centre. Police are keeping an eye on them. No management from the post office has as yet addressed the disgruntled workers since they started striking. Kodisang Bokaba who is representing the Democratic Postal Communications Union (DPCU), South African Postal Workers Union (SAPWS) and Communications Workers Union (CWU) said: “The Post Office workers have not received a salary increase for three years. "Now the employer has started negotiations with a 0% increase. Workers decided that they are not going to accept that.” “A dispute has been declared with the CCMA and as a result we met with the employer but they still insisted on the 0% increase. "On Tuesday we met again at the CCMA in Johannesburg and the final offer of the employer was 6%.” Bokaba said no amount of threats by the employer would make them relent. “The employer is threatening workers that if there are any more increases there will be retrenchments,” he said. “We are saying there is no relationship between wage demands and the strike. We want to conclude a wage agreement which will better serve the workers in this difficult time,” Bokaba added. He said employees worked under worrying conditions. “Workers at the Tshwane Mail Centre work under freezing temperatures because there are no heaters or air conditioning. Also about 800 people have to share only four toilets.” He said they will continue until their demands were met.
