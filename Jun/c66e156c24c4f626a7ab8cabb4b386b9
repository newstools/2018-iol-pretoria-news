But beyond blowing the vuvuzela and trying out local cuisine, they also had a fashion lesson  from D’S Damat men’s store at Menlyn Park shopping centre. The group - Veronica, Tatiana, Dmitry and Slav - arrived two weeks ago and is being hosted by television personality Somizi Mhlongo. “I’ve met many people in my life but no one like him (Somizi),” said Dmitry. “There is literally never a dull moment around him. I’ve learntso many things about South Africa, and even learnt how to do the vosho dance.” At Menlyn, Dmitry and Slav strutted up and down the cosmopolitan men’s fashion store. After much deliberation and indecisiveness and about 10 outfits later, the boys finally got the winning combination. Asked what they thought of South Africa so far, Pogosov jokingly said: “I haven’t seen a rhino or lion on the road yet.” He said what he appreciated most about the country was the architecture. “We have a lot of beautiful buildings in Moscow but nothing like here. I can’t stop taking pictures of them,” he said. The four will be in the country for the duration of the World Cup. It started when TV  host Minnie Dlamini visited Russia in search of the “coolest” Russians to come to South Africa to experience the World Cup South African style. Dlamini went to Russia on a location shoot for the sports show, From Russia With Love. When she got there she was confronted with very little promotional signage on the World Cup. She and her producers decided on a plan to look for and find Russian fans to bring back to the country. “I searched for days for the Russians and we really found an incredible group of people, who are so excited about their African adventure,” Dlamini said.
