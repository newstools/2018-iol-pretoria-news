“This movement will form part of drug and substance abuse because tobacco is also a drug. A lot of people in the country have died because of tobacco, and due to that we are doing this to save lives,” said Du Plooy. The City aimed to focus on the youth. “We will visit schools in communities to persuade young people not to start smoking. We are going to form a steering committee of people who are passionate about the issue and who would also like to see a tobacco-free capital city.” City officials, non-profit organisations and interested parties gathered at the CSIR Convention Centre. Dr Heng Koong from the Philippines explained how his country worked hard towards creating a tobacco-free generation. Public education had been the best method to achieve the movement’s vision and goal. “Young people have so much power in society. If we can persuade them not to smoke, then our goal will be achieved," he said. “It is best to have an engagement with both smokers and non-smokers because once one starts to smoke it will be difficult to get them to quit. “Also show those smoking how they affect others around them and the fact that it actually costs more trying to convince someone to quit smoking.” He told Du Plooy and those gathered that the “ground-up approach” was the best way to achieve a tobacco-free generation. “It is no secret that young people nowadays like social media, so as much as we go to schools, we also communicate with them on different media platforms, and that really has a positive effect.” He further noted that the law somehow limited the public from thinking beyond smoking as there were laws that made it legal to smoke at a certain age and in certain areas. “It is due to these laws that it is sometimes difficult to achieve a tobacco-free generation, and our governments need to look into this,” he said.
