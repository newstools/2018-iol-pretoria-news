“UNRWA commissioner-general Pierre Krahenbuhl will hold a press conference in Gaza on Monday (today) where he will announce the kick-off of the campaign,” UNRWA’s media adviser Adnan Abu Hasna said. The conference will send a message to the international 
community to start a funding campaign to help UNRWA continue providing its services to the Palestinian refugees. “The agency is facing 
unprecedented challenges,” Abu Hasna said. The campaign comes days after the US decided to decrease its contribution to UNRWA this year from $125 million to $65m. The US administration has also announced it will not provide the agency with $45m for aid that it pledged last December. US President, Donald Trump has recently threatened to reduce aid to the Palestinians if they refuse to return to the negotiation table with Israel. The US donates $364m annually to UNRWA, making it the largest sole contributor to the UN agency. UNRWA, which provides assistance in education, health and food to some 5 million registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East, is already suffering from a $49m financial deficit and any fund suspension would have a negative impact on its work. - Xinhua
