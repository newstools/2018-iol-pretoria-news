Despite wet weather predicted in other areas of the country, city residents should not worry about  rainy days and rather brace for some hot, sizzling summer days, SA Weather Service forecaster Lulama Pheme advised.  “The people of Pretoria must not stress over rain because it will be fine weather over the next couple of days.  "They can expect weather that ranges from warm to hot weather conditions," Pheme said. "Residents must expect maximums of close to 40ºC because these are normal summer temperatures in Pretoria,” she added. Pretoria would have a 30% chance of rain today. However, from Thursday no rain was expected, and temperatures would be at a minimum of 15ºC and a maximum of 29ºC, she said. On Friday, the city could expect a low of 15ºC, reaching 31ºC. Saturday’s mercury would rise to 32ºC and on Sunday it would hit 34ºC, she added. Pheme said what transpired in some regions of Mpumalanga, hit by thunderstorms which combined to form a tornado at the weekend, was a different story altogether. The adverse weather wreaked havoc on houses and left people scrambling for cover.  As the week continued, both Mpumalanga and Limpopo would experience some drizzle around their escarpment with cloudy conditions, and the Eastern Cape would also experience cloudy conditions.  The south-western parts of the country have a 30% chance of rainfall. Pheme said the capital might not experience wet weather, but a cold front would brush the southern parts of the country on Saturday. Meanwhile, residents here could relax and enjoy the summer heat and, of course, remember to drink liquids, she said. Pretoria News
