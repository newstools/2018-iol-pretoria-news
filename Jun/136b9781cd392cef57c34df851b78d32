Acting Sars commissioner Mark Kingon said the revenue service had experienced falling compliance in outstanding returns across all taxes. Kingon said Sars was more concerned about the growing tendency of companies to withhold VAT and PAYE. “The Sars outstanding returns campaign will be boosted this year to bring this matter under control,” Kingon said. “Sars is also collaborating with the Department of Justice to expedite the prosecution of tax offences.” Sars said it had collected R700 million less in taxes in the 2017/18 financial year than its February revised target.
