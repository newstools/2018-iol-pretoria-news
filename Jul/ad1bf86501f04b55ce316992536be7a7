“I am very happy at the Titans, and also very excited about what we are trying to do as a brand and as an internationally recognised franchise. To that end, I have no plans to leave the Titans, despite speculation suggesting this,” Faul clarified. He has been at the forefront of a wave of Titans success, on and off the field, and remains committed to entrenching them as an industry leader. “We want to keep on raising our standards, and there are a lot of exciting prospects on the horizon for us as a franchise. I want to be a part of that journey, and that is why I am not planning on leaving SuperSport Park any time soon.” That said, Faul did note that the Titans and the Bulls enjoyed a wonderful relationship, one that would continue to grow through its locality and its deeply entrenched links. “I have a very strong relationship with Barend van Graan (current Bulls chief executive), and our two sporting bodies share the same kinship. We have even engaged in a partnership, which is something we hope to grow and get even closer. There is no doubt we share many fans across our city because rugby and cricket have always gone hand in hand with our culture,” Faul said. His role was praised by the newly-elected president of Northerns Cricket Union, Tebogo Siko. “Jacques has been a wonderful servant for the franchise, and the Northerns Cricket Union. He has really batted for us in the boardroom, he remains integral to the process and is a real asset to the team. In a personal capacity, he has welcomed me fully into my new position,” Siko noted. - African News Agency (ANA)
