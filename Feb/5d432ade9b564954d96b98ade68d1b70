In addition, the pitch had been neglected and grass left to grow, which made it difficult for Arcadia Shepherds and other football teams to use the legendary stadium. As a result parents and coaches were up in arms. One of the parents said her son had found used condoms and empty packets of what looked like nyaope following the bash. After numerous complaints by parents, the City finally heeded the calls and cleaned up the stadium over the weekend. Arcadia Shepherds coach Dennis Maduna said he was thankful to the City for clearing the mess and cutting the grass. “Finally my boys can resume play on a better turf. I’m thankful to the City, but more could still be done, especially with water leaks around the stadium.” He said it left puddles of water which over time become unsanitary. “Many parents have complained about this. They are concerned that their children might contract diseases from the dirty water,” he said. The stadium has in the past been surrounded by controversy. The former ANC-led administration wanted to turn the iconic stadium into an R100million inner city park. However, that decision was overturned by the DA-led City government, with mayor Solly Msimanga assembling a task team to safeguard the stadium to make sure it remained a sporting field instead of the proposed park. “I have instructed a task team to ensure that the historical Caledonian Stadium remains a sports field where sport fanatics can continue to use it,” Msimanga said. The task team, according to Msimanga, would evaluate the stadium and provide feedback on what else was needed to improve it and make it user-friendly again.
