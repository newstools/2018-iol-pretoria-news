Herbert Berendt, cultural attaché at the German embassy, was praising a performance by the Deutsche Schule Pretoria (DSP), and it pretty much summed up the impressions of many of the guests at a benefit dinner held in support of the school’s orchestra at Time Square at Menlyn. The orchestra performed pieces including themes of two James Bond movies - Dr No and Skyfall. The Gauteng Opera also performed at the event, hosted at Forti Grill & Bar, owned by renowned restaurateur and music aficionado Fortunato Mazzone, who elected to host the musical event at a special cost price as it was something close to his heart. A raffle was also held during the evening. The benefit dinner was in aid of the DSP’s Young Musicians Development Fund (YMDP), initiated to assist less fortunate learners to pay for their instrument loan fees and lessons. The DSP sees its orchestra as a tool to burnish its curricular credentials and bolster its outreach initiatives. It maintains that music is a universal language that in its harmonious sweep can unite people of diverse backgrounds and cultures, thereby laying the foundations for peaceful co-existence. The orchestra is also diverse both culturally and socio-economically. Commenting on the event, known as Vivace, or lively execution, conductor Sonja Kirsch said it paved the way for participants’ musical futures. Walter Johannes, a former member of the school’s board, hailed music as intrinsic to pupils’ overall learning process.
