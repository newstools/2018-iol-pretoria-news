“We plead with residents and the business community to be serious about conserving water,” said spokesperson Lindela Mashigo. The plea followed a notification from Rand Water that the abstraction of water from the Vaal Dam exceeded the allowable licensed limit as determined by the National Department of Water and Sanitation. Due to this, Mashigo said, Rand Water had, as of Monday, begun to limit its water supply to stay within the permissible existing water abstraction limit. “The restrictions are applicable throughout the city. "The restrictions are done to ensure there is a continued control and supply of water to all residents. "Our consumers are urged to manage water in a far more effective and efficient way by adjusting the manner in which they utilise it. If this appeal is heeded, water-related interruptions will be minimised,” Mashigo said. Residents needed to continue to use grey water for watering gardens and flushing toilets, report water leaks and burst pipes, and install water-saving devices.
