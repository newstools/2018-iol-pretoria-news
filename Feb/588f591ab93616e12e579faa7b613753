This is a major recognition at a continental level for his pioneering work in science and technology. The award is the AU's recognition of the highest level of the programme, and celebrates top African scientists for their valuable achievements, research and discoveries. Maaza, who is the incumbent of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) Unisa Chair in Nanosciences and Nanotechnology, received the award. It was presented by the AU and Unesco in recognition of the nanotechnology research he has carried out in South Africa. Aside from the honour, Maaza has been awarded a prize of almost $100 000 (R1.2 million). Maaza and the team under his leadership have been the first worldwide to report several scientific 
phenomena. In a letter recommending the
award, Unisa principal and vice- chancellor Professor Mandala Ma- khanya said: "Carrying the bulk of his research in South Africa generally, (Maaza) pioneered world-class nanoscience research both within the continent and at the international level... Maaza expressed his appreciation on behalf of all scientists in Africa, indicating that platforms such as this highlighted the research strides which were being made on the 
continent.
