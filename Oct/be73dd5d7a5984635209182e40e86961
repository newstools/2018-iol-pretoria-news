From late September to the end of October, and sometime into November, the jacarandas bloom all over Pretoria and turn the face of the city purple. It is estimated that there are almost 70 000 jacarandas growing around the many streets, parks and gardens of Pretoria. While jacaranda mimosifolia is not indigenous to South Africa and was introduced from Brazil to South Africa in 1829, the invader tree has existed in Pretoria, much to the delight of residents. It elicited an order that jacarandas must not be eradicated. Some of Pretoria's oldest jacarandas can be found around Bosman and Celliers streets - the first jacarandas were planted in these areas. There is also a claim that the biggest and oldest jacaranda in Pretoria can be found on the corner of Eastwood and Stanza Bopape streets. Local history has it that the first two jacaranda trees in Pretoria were planted by JD Celliers in Celliers Street in 1888. One can be found inside Sunnyside Primary School, planted by Celliers in 1888. But all the older suburbs, including Waterkloof and Riviera, have good showings of the trees. Although Pretoria would like to claim all the glory after being nicknamed Jacaranda City, Joburg actually has more jacaranda trees than the South African capital city and seat of the national government.
