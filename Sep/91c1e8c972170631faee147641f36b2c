The Gauteng Department of Education has extended the deadline for public comments regarding school admission policy for the 2020 school year. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, officially tabled the proposed amendments to the school admissions policy at a public meeting held at Sutherland High school, in Centurion on August 21. Lesufi, addressing parents on the draft amendments highlighted how the changes were instituted to ensure the department was aligned with the National legislation and complied with a Constitutional court judgment of determining feeder zones. He said these would also clarify ambiguity following the court battles the department had faced most recently. These included challenges to admission of learners at schools such as Overkruin, Montana and Afrikaanse Hoër Meisieskool. Steve Mabona, Education spokesperson, said the department was eager to hear concerns from parents and education stakeholders regarding the proposed amendments. “We urge parents to participate in this process, as it is of utmost importance to receive public input. "We implore all parents to heed our call and submit their input before the cut off date.” Mabona said the amendments were still available for download on the departments website. Written comments may be submitted until September 14, and may be posted to the departments head offices in Johannesburg or hand delivered. Emails may also be sent to the following address: Faizel.Peerbhai@gauteng.gov.za.
