A Re Yeng buses have resumed operations into and out of Mamelodi - with the metro police keeping watch, following yesterday’s stoppage of the service. The service to the township was halted following threats that buses would be torched by passengers unhappy that they were always overcrowded. “Tshwane Rapid Transit  (TRT) is pleased to announce that all A Re yeng buses in Mamelodi will as from today resume operations after serious threats of vandalism were reported, resulting in the suspension of operations on Monday. “TRT wishes to thank all their loyal commuters for their patience and understanding. "We want to assure commuters that their safety, and that of staff and assets is TRT's priority,” A Re Yeng said in a statement. The decision to escort the buses was made at an urgent meeting yesterday convened by MMC for Roads and Transport Sheila Senkubuge with top City officials following the threats. On Sunday night, A Re Yeng said it had received threats on social media and on the ground that the buses would be burnt. Senkubuge said the threats were not taken lightly. About 8000 commuters from Mamelodi were forced to use alternative transport as a result yesterday.
