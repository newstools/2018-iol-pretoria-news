ALL Whiters should prepare for the annual Tshwane All White Jazz Benefit Concert on December 16. Ringo Madlingozi, Bucie and Solly Moholo were introduced to the lineup by organisers at the benefit concert's launch at Gold Rush Morula in Mabopane. They told the media to expect the Mabopane streets to turn into a beautiful mess. An all star-studded line-up consisting of more than 40 talented artists will shake the Gold Rush sports grounds. The benefit concert was launched as a platform to celebrate the Tshwane All White Jazz and Soul Benefit Concert's eleventh anniversary as well as introduce new partners and line-ups. Managing director Thabiso Mosima, said the event was not all about soul and jazz but about charity. â€œWe have adopted three homes we are helping in terms of their basic needs. Businesses are also invited to sell food, ice, accessories, water, beverages and clothing. Industry heavyweights include crowd puller Mafikizolo, Kelly Khumalo, Rhythmic Elements, Dj Maphorisa and Fifi Cooper. The Masters of Ceremony include the likes of Teddy the MC, Dineo Moloisane, Peter Mashata, Salesman, Mawisa and Machuchu. Members of the media got an opportunity to learn about the business opportunities by also partaking in a series of adventure sports such as Paintball and kart-biking courtesy of Xplorers Paintball Company.
