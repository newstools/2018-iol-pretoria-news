Pretoria - Police Minister Bheki Cele and national police commissioner Khehla Sitole announced on Monday morning that the police would employ a new integrated strategy to combat a string of aggravated cash-in-transit robberies, murders, house robberies and assaults. Cele and Sitole addressed media in the presence of police leadership from other provinces. They planned to attend crime intelligence sessions starting as early as Tuesday. Cele said these aggravated crimes sparked concerns countrywide but the police were prepared to work together with communities to shutdown organised criminals. Cele said a majority of illegal firearms used to commit these aggravated crimes and assaults came from the communities. He said some of these firearms were taken from their owners during house robberies and that's how they ended in the wrong hands. Sitole said there are a few illegal firearms that were taken from the possession of policemen and policewomen. However, significant steps would be taken to help officers to better secure their firearms. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

To deal with corrupt police officers who aided criminals, Sitole explained that lifestyle audits would be conducted to identify and arrest such officers. He said corrupt police officers were currently being arrested as they commit crimes just like any other criminal. The minister added that major steps would be taken to flush out all corrupt police officers helping criminals to commit crimes. The police currently had a 72 hour response time but there were pending efforts to boost the 10111 office to improve response time. Sitole said advanced technology would be used to achieve swifter response to better assist communities. Pretoria News
