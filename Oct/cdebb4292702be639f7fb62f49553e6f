Pretoria - If you are in Pretoria this weekend, do not to plan any outdoor activities on Saturday afternoon, as temperatures will drop. There are also likely to be thunderstorms. The SA Weather Service has warned residents to brace themselves for a chilly weekend as a cold front moving from the south coast would have reached the province and City on Saturday afternoon. Forecaster Bransby Bulo said there was a cold front affecting the south coast and moving towards the Eastern Cape area. Due to that, he said, cold air was expected to hit Gauteng. “The cold air travelling from the Eastern Cape is expected to reach Gauteng today, and residents can expect thunderstorms in the afternoon. “The temperature is, however, expected to get warmer into the beginning of the new week,” he said. The drop of temperature set to hit Gauteng follows last week’s strong winds and hailstorm which swept across the province. The hailstorm caused traffic congestions in the City as low-water bridges were flooding. Worst affected areas were the northern and western areas, including Hammanskraal, Temba, Pretoria West and Pretoria North. Bulo further mentioned that the regular drop of temperature in the country was normal during this season. Pretoria News
