Pretoria - The University of Pretoria has received more than R830 000 to help preserve photographs and records related to the pre-colonial Kingdom of Mapungubwe. The US embassy awarded the institution with the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation during a grant signing ceremony, held at the university's Old Arts Building yesterday. The funding seeks to support significant cultural heritage projects around the world. The institution was selected to receive the prestigious grant following a worldwide competition for funds, provided by the American Ambassador initiative in more than 100 countries, to support the preservation of culture sites, cultural objects and forms of traditional cultural expression. During the ceremony, the university's Professor Caroline Nicholson said the funding would be used for the development of archives. “It will be for research associated with building the documentation and collection of more documentation – essentially the preservation of the archives, as well as the development of the archives.” She said the institution was appreciative of being the recipient of the contribution. Chargé d’affaires Jessica Lapenn said the university's proposal was selected in recognition of its important local and future global impact. She said through the fund the US showed respect for the history and culture of other nations. “This money is about preserving South African heritage for South Africans. This money will be used to save the world's patrimony. It's about protecting artefacts, items or documents so that they are there for our future study or learning,” she said. It is the second time that the university has received the grant. In 2013, the Mapungubwe Museum received an award for conservation of the late iron-age ivory and bone tool collection. Lapenn said the latest contribution would cement the ongoing partnership the embassy has with the university. “Our partnership with the University of Pretoria continues to grow.”
