The management should thus be commended for championing the renaming of residences to African names, as we reported yesterday and today. However, it almost feels like an opportunity to really transform the residences and unashamedly go African has been missed here. The renaming of Inca to Ikageng, Lilium to Hayani and Kiaat to Tirisano is revolutionary. But other changes, such as Jasmyn to House Khutso, Katjiepiering to Azalea, Klaradyn to House Nala and Magrietjie to House Mags, can hardly be labelled ethnic African; they are African merely by association. Kollege residence becoming College makes no sense; neither does Maroela to Morula Legae, Mopanie to Mopane or Taaibos to The Tower. Then there are names such as Asterhof, Madelief, Nerina, Zinnia, Xayata, Jakaranda, Hippokrates and Tuksdorp that have been kept. Why keep them? If Tuks management is serious about going African, there are millions of names that are truly African. These are the names that are as African as the Limpopo River, Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape and uKha- hlamba Drakensberg Park. Tuks made huge strides a few months ago when it ditched Afrikaans as a language of instruction amid fierce criticism. The renaming of the residences is a positive step and goes a long way towards proving that the university is seriously and honestly on a mission to transform.
