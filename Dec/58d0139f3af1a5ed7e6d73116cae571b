During an event convened to commemorate World Aids Day, hundreds of beneficiaries of a programme implemented through the South African National Parks (SANParks) further committed to making their communities aware that Aids “affects all of us”. Although World Aids Day was marked on December 1, the beneficiaries and employees at the project only had their commemoration on Friday. It was a vibrant event attended by ward councillor Phumzile Hlatshwayo and project management under the leadership of David Mbulaheni. Guest speakers came from Tlamelong Clinic, Ga-Rankuwa View and Love-Life, while DJ Edit and SMU FM breakfast show presenter Percy Sleash kept the audience on their feet with some of the country’s hottest music. All speakers encouraged those present to know their health status - and in line with this, free screening was provided for HIV and TB, among other viruses. But the highlight of the event was the lighting of a candle, after which the pledge was read out “to symbolise the healing of the pain we feel from within, the pain of fear, loss, rejection and isolation”. Part of the pledge also read: “May the light of love reach out and touch our brothers, sisters and children infected with HIV and ill with Aids; women left to shoulder the burden of care for the loved ones “May the light of hope infuse the whole nation with the spirit of ubuntu; may we give strength to families and people who support and care for the affected and ill” The Ga-Rankuwa project has created more than 227 temporary, but continual jobs for previously unemployed people. It is expected that more than 900 jobs will be created once the project is fully operational. Furthermore, the programme aims to put over 500000 pupils behind a quality school desk in addition to fighting poverty by creating sustainable job opportunities and develop skills among the poor.
