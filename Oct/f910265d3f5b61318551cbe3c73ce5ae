DURBAN – Pam Golding Properties has been recognised as South Africa’s ‘Best Estate Agency South Africa” at the International Property Awards (IPA) for the 11th time. The awards that were held in Dubai celebrate the best levels of achievement by companies operating in all sectors of the property and real estate industry. Pam Golding also received the Best Real Estate Marketing South Africa award and the Best Real Estate Website South Africa award. Andrew Golding, chief executive of the Pam Golding Property group said: "Receiving these awards signifies a substantial return on the investment that we, as a group, make in our agents and staff, in ongoing marketing innovations and in the most advanced technology." He added that globally, the real estate world has changed rapidly, from the start of the ‘shopping’ process, through to the actual transactional journey itself and the settlement of a successful sale. The award for the best website is judged on numerous criteria, including features, design, appearance and finish, speed and compatibility. As the entry for the Best Real Estate Agency category is required to be based on one selected office within the organisation, this year Pam Golding Properties focused on its Sea Point office on the Cape Atlantic Seaboard. Offering a whole spectrum of property services and completing more than 10 000 transactions per annum, the Pam Golding Property group has a network of over 300 offices in sub-Saharan Africa and internationally.
