The decision was announced by MMC for Roads and Transport Sheila-Lynn Senkubuge after a break-in over the weekend. Senkubuge said the decision not to handle cash was taken by the City to ensure the safety of both customers and staff members using the centre. All safes at the centre were forcefully opened with what Senkubuge said appeared to be grinding power tools. She said the cashless service would be in effect until all the damaged safes had been replaced. “The establishment has made provision for credit and debit card payments for all services. The City apologies for any inconvenience caused by the regrettable incident.” One guard was assaulted during the incident and a firearm stolen. The robbers looted the centre of approximately 150 000 blank face documents, Senkubuge said. While Waltloo will be operating on a cashless basis, other licensing centres will also be migrating to a similar system as soon as possible. Senkubuge said they believed the recent incident was linked to last year’s spate of break-ins at numerous licensing centres around the city. In early July last year, licensing centres in the city, including Centurion and Waltloo, were broken into. Another break-in at the Akasia centre was foiled. At Centurion and Waltloo, eNatis screens and camera equipment were stolen, leaving many motorists frustrated with the limited services available. “The recent break-in is considered to be an act of crime with no other agenda but criminality, and can’t be prevented as with other crimes.” Pretoria News
