While signage warning them about the unsafe lifts was still on display, Mathebula insisted that independent assessors had given the lifts the all-clear. The notice reads: “Notice to all occupants (patients/staff and visitors). Please note that although every action is being taken to ensure that the lifts/elevators are available at all times, it has been found that they have reached their end of life and are currently just getting kept going while the process of replacing them is being finalised. “The process will take a minimum of six months. Management can neither guarantee their safety nor their reliability.” However, Mathebula said some of the signs were removed earlier this year following the correction of issues related to safety. He said two independent assessments were conducted on the lifts’ safety with the most recent being last month. Notices left were referring to the reliability of some of the lifts in terms of them being functional at all times. “The hospital and Department of Infrastructure Development are actively trying to address this element of availability through ensuring that they are fixed as soon as they go down and they do not get stuck. “If a lifts gets stuck, technicians get it opened soonest. “The Gauteng departments of Health and Infrastructure Development are working on their replacement with new ones.” But DA provincial spokesperson for health Jack Bloom said the safety of the lifts had been a problem for a long time. He was adamant that a long-term solution was needed and the sooner hospitals were in charge of such needs the better, as the Department of Infrastructure Development was too dysfunctional to manage things.
