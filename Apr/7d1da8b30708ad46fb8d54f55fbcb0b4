The original bridge was washed away during the heavy floods in 2014, and since then residents and transport operators in Mabopane and surrounding areas had been forced to take a detour while travelling in and out of the area. But the good news is that the restoration of the bridge was on track and progressing well, transport spokesperson Melitah Madiba has said. “Transport operators and commuters will soon be able to travel shorter distances like they used to as the bridge is estimated to be completed in June,” Madiba said. The project was launched last June by the Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Dr Ismail Vadi. At the time, residents had sent a petition to the department complaining about the unsafe bridge. In the petition, the residents complained that it took them hours just to get to areas in the vicinity, distances that normally took a few minutes when the bridge was still intact. During the launch of the construction, Vadi told residents that the department would build a new bridge which would be slightly higher than the old one. “The entire road will be lifted up; it will be a longer bridge and will have pedestrian walkways on both sides with barrier guards for safety,” he said, adding it would be a 10-month long project. Madiba said it now would take 12 months, costing the department R33million. Since the reconstruction started, the route leading to the bridge had been closed. The scope of the project included the reconstruction of a new two-lane, single carriageway and a surfaced road.
