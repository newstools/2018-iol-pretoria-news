Pretoria - Wife killer Omar Sabadia will not walk out of the Kgosi Mampuru Prison on June 20 after it emerged that the Parole Review Board will review the decision to release him on parole. The lawyer acting for Sabadia’s three children, Ahmed Suliman, said the Parole Board has given him an undertaking that Sabadia will not be released next week as previously believed. The matter will now be reviewed after the children and the family of murdered Zahida Sabadia vehemently objected to his release. Suliman was informed that the decision to place Sabadia on parole is suspended pending the decision of the review board. Sabadia was informed that he had to submit written representations to the prison authorities by June 28, as to why he was entitled to parole. He was told that he would be informed accordingly as to the developments of his case. READ: Wife killer's children 'not ready for his release' Daughter Anjum Moosa said on Thursday that she was relieved that her father will remain behind bars for now. “This is good news. We are obviously happy that the review board will reconsider his release this month.” She said she is not sure about the process which will be followed during the review,  but she and her siblings hoped that they could be there. “We hope that we can have our say,” she said. Sabadia was due to be released at the end of next week after spending about 20 years in jail of his effective 50 year jail term. Pretoria News
