The visit was part of a process to give them an idea of what others did to honour the holiday. They joined in the activities organised for the children and played and ate with them, making the day a beautiful and memorable one. The children also engaged in various sporting activities, danced and shared knowledge about traditional games. While the children played on the lawns, the adults took to the braai stands to take turns flipping delicious beef, chicken and boerewors to share with the children. Manager Lovery Ngobeni, an orphan, said Sunday was all about ensuring that the children felt and enjoyed the love all children deserved. “This centre is about giving the children a place to call home and ensuring that they feel the warmth of a family. That’s why if you look at how it is built, you can see it’s more about providing a homely feel than trying to just house vulnerable children who would otherwise have nowhere else to go. “That is why we are so proud to host a day like this and treat these children. We want them to know that in us they will always have parents who love and cherish them. I am an orphan; I don’t take these things lightly because I know how important they are to children who were previously abused, abandoned or neglected.” Ngobeni’s assistant Naomi Brink said it was always special to do something nice for the children, because they enjoyed and cherished every moment. She said the love the community, sponsors and funders have shown the centre and its children was greatly appreciated. The centre houses a total of 47 children in its seven houses, and each house had its own housemother. The eighth house, built by American sponsors, is nearly complete and could help give more orphans a home. The centre has an early learning centre that benefits the entire Mabopane community.
