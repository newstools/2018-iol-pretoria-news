SOUTH African rapper Cassper Nyovest is set to feature on the official anthem for the 2018 Fifa World Cup, taking place this year in Russia.
US R&B star Jason Derulo will be creating the official soundtrack for the football showpiece with a song titled Colors, in collaboration with Coca-Cola. The song is set to celebrate the vibrancy and excitement that comes with the arrival of the world’s biggest football tournament. “I was honoured to work with Coca-Cola to create an anthem celebrating every team and their fans. Colors represents the different flags and cultures from around the world and will get everyone moving to a unifying beat,” said Derulo. The song will feature on his upcoming album. “Music is something that brings us all together. I started off with the concept and then kind of freestyled from there. Colors talks about how we all have an identity. My song, my message, for that to be able to spread its wings and take its own life, I think it is incredible. Everybody should be able to just be proud of who they are.” Here at home the multi-award-winning Nyovest - real name Refiloe Phoolo - was selected to represent the country on a global stage. “Coming from a nation of colourful people, this anthem will speak to South Africans as the song captures our passions for football and Coca-Cola. Working with Coca-Cola and Jason De- rulo has been a thrilling journey and we hope that this anthem will be well received by the fans getting ready for the 2018 Fifa World Cup.” The song will be released on March 16.
