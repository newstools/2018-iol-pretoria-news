Responding to questions in the National Assembly, Ramaphosa said where tracts of urban land were held privately purely for speculative purposes or lying fallow, local authorities needed to investigate such circumstances so that the government could decide how to deal with it. He was responding to EFF leader Julius Malema who asked whether expropriation was an option to allow people to escape the indignity of townships, which he termed “concentration camps” created by apartheid. Ramaphosa said vast areas of urban land were owned by local authorities, state-owned enterprises and government departments that did not use it. The land should be released as serviced stands, because many South Africans indicated they were prepared to build their own homes, he said. “Our people must be given that land and that land owned by local entities does not even need to be bought, so that is a form of expropriation Quite a bit is owned by state-owned enterprises and some by various government departments. Those must be identified, serviced and released to our people. “Our new development is that we should move our people close to economic opportunities. The measures we should take include expropriation. Some land is held for specific reasons, some of it is just lying fallow ” The measures would be implemented “in an orderly fashion and in accordance with our Constitution”. Ramaphosa has raised a political storm by confirming last month that the ANC planned to push ahead with plans to amend the Constitution to define in which instances land could be expropriated without compensation. - African News Agency (ANA)
