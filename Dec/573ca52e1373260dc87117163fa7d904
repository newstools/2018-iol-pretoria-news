The competition was for people aged between seven and 35, as part of the City’s strategy of encouraging lifelong learning and a culture of reading. Paseka Selinyana, 23, from Mabopane, acknowledged the importance of indigenous languages, but opposed their relevance. Afterwards, he said the competition and preparation for it had taught him to broaden his knowledge on the topic. He said he wished to take the activity to his community to encourage the youth to debate burning issues which concerned them. “Our team explained why indigenous languages were no longer relevant. We discussed things such as international relations and the expansion of information to larger groups to make our argument strong,” said Selinyana. Owen Msiza, 19, from Winterveldt, said the competition came at a time when young people needed proper training to become good public speakers. “Knowing how to speak or engage with people is a skill I would like the youth to acquire. Initiatives such as this help the youth a lot to acquire these skills.” The competition, which was launched this month, will be held annually.
