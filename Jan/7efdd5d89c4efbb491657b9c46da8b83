Future Park is a digital universe which has attracted more than five million children across the world, to play in an ever-changing digital environment. This is its first time in South Africa. The exhibition’s fun, interactive activities captivate the imagination and introduce children to the marvels of technology taking drawings they have made and making them come to life on life-sized screens.
For example, at the aquarium, children draw and colour fish and other water creatures. These are then scanned and come to life before their creators’ eyes. In a sketch town, children can “build” 3D models where cars, trains and boats move on road, rail and waterways. The light-ball orchestra area is filled with balls of different sizes that change colour and play music as children play with them. Another popular attraction is the game of hopscotch that responds with a burst of colour as children hop on the squares and, for the younger visitors a magical table that reacts when it is touched. It opens on February 24 at the Silverstar Casino at Muldersdrift and will be open from 10am to 6pm daily. Tickets are R130 for adults and R115 for pensioners and children over 18 months. A family package for two adults and two children is R460.

This is a great adventure for the whole family. “It’s hard to describe the magic of this place, but we were all truly wowed.” - Julie, editor of Heart Mama Blog
