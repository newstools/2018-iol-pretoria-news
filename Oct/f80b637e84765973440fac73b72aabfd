DURBAN – Garmin has announced that it will be merging Spotify into its Fenix Plus series of watches. The new integration will allow users of the watch and a Spotify Premium account to download and listen to music offline. The Fenix 5 Plus is Garmin's most popular watch, but before this new feature was added all you could do was control the music on your phone from the watch. People that have a Spotify Premium account can sync playlists to the Fenix 5 Plus via Wi-Fi and then access the playlists through the watch's Spotify app. The Spotify app is available now for Garmin customers with a Fenix 5 Plus watch in the Connect IQ store. According to Garmin, this feature will also be available on Garmin Fenix 5 Plus watches in South Africa too.
