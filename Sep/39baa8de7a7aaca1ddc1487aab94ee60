“Congratulations to KG on being named Gauteng Sportsman of the Year,” said CSA chief executive Thabang Moroe. “It represents a wonderful double for him after he was previously named South African Cricketer of the Year for the second time and almost swept the boards at our own awards function. “Prior to that, the ICC honoured him in January when they named him in their select Test team of the Year for 2017, and for a period was also the No 1 ranked Test-match bowler, the youngest player ever to achieve this honour. “Above all, he comes across as a man of great humility who has his feet firmly on the ground and will continue to be a wonderful role model for aspiring young cricketers.” African News Agency (ANA)
