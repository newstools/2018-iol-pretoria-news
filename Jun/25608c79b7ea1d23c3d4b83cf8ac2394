Speaking after successfully challenging her expulsion from the party in the Western Cape High Court, De Lille said she was energised to serve the people of the city as the ruling affirmed her position as mayor, but added she would continue her fight to clear her name. “Tomorrow I’m back in this court because all of these allegations that they continue to put out there in public are untested allegations. "They have refused to give us the evidence of the allegations, so tomorrow again the court must now rule and force them to give us the evidence. What kind of justice is that?” she asked yesterday. De Lille, who still risks expulsion from the DA, is challenging the findings of the Steenhuisen report, named after one of its authors, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen. She has accused the party of withholding a letter and a cellphone message on which the report was based. The internal investigation was headed by Steenhuisen and informed the DA’s decision to sanction De Lille for misconduct. The documents which De Lille has demanded are a letter from city councillor JP Smith, the mayoral committee member for safety and security, and an SMS that she allegedly sent relating to the performance scoring of former city manager Achmat Ebrahim at the time he applied for the position. It is alleged that De Lille demanded a good scoring for Ebrahim as she wanted him to secure the job, a charge she denies. He resigned after the allegations were made and currently faces 
suspension. Yesterday, the DA indicated it would be studying the judgment before deciding on further action, which could include an appeal of the ruling. The party has also indicated it would move for another motion of no confidence in De Lille. - African News Agency (ANA)
