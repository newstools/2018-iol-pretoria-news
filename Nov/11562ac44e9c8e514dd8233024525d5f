The festival will start with BET award-winning star Sjava sharing the stage with N’gud hitmaker Kwesta. The festival attracts more than 10000 people annually. Sjava, 33, (real name Jabulani Hadebe) held the country’s flag high when he walked away with Viewers’ Choice Best International Act award at the BETs in June. State Theatre producer Keamogetswe Moeketsane yesterday said they wanted people to get the best experience from him after his tour. “Since his BET award, Pretoria has not heard his full-length album, so its a chance to actually hear how he’s grown over the time that he has toured. “And they get an opportunity to hear his sound and get an acoustic feel of it, and a live version of how his music is versus it being played on the radio.” Moeketsane said Kwesta (real name Senzo Vilakazi) would also give audiences an out of the ordinary experience. “Kwesta is a great hitmaker in terms of hip hop. It’s time to actually see him as a musician and hear how he works with the band.” Moeketsane said both artists would have a five-piece band when they perform just to give fans a more intimate theatre feel. “They are coming with a full-on five-piece band so its going to give it an extra edge, and a live performance feel so it is not just playing with backing tracks. Moeketsane said they wanted to give the crowd a different feel of the artists’ performance. “I think it is just going to give it that intimate theatre feel and it will feel more like a production than just when you see them perform at a club or elsewhere,” she told the Pretoria News. Part of the line-up of the festival, which runs until December 15, also includes Vusi Nova, Ringo Madlingozi, Thandiswa Mazwai, Lebo Sekgobela and Dr Tumi. Madlingozi is paired with Nova. For a first at the State Theatre, gospel star Dr Tumi will deliver hope and restoration to audiences, and Sekgobela is another gospel act featured in the line-up. Ticket prices range from R200 to R400 and are available at Computicket.
