DURBAN – Employees are seen as one of the biggest threats to an organisation’s IT security however according to Charl Ueckermann, chief executive at AVeS Cyber Security, they can actually act as a powerful defence against cyber-security threats. Ueckermann said, “Educating employees on cyber threats and how to use IT resources and the internet securely can help lower security risks, as well as the costs associated with managing those risks. He added that employees can unintentionally expose their company networks and data to cyber threats in many ways. These actions pose a danger not only to the company network but to the end-users themselves. Besides the risk of malware, they could open themselves up to the risk of fraud or identity theft. However, when employees are aware of the risks associated with these actions, and they understand the dos and don’ts, they become contributors to the IT security strategy rather than a threat. “Protecting an organisation’s networks and data takes both technological and behavioural intervention. In fact, effective IT security is the result of managed interplay between people, processes and technology," said Ueckermann.
