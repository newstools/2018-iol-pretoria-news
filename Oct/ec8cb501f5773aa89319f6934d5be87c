Association chairperson Paul Rantaung openly talked about how the provincial Department of Roads and Transport was reluctant to implement a 2014 court ruling allowing his members to use the route. CPETA members were stopped from using the route and kicked out of Bloed Street Taxi Rank in 2015. Rantaung said the problems started after the department allegedly issued an operating licence for the use of the same route to a taxi association called Simunye. He said the licence was issued after a decision was taken behind his back to merge Central Top Eleven and Burgersfort Long Distance Taxi Association to form Simunye. He alleged that fraud was committed during the merger as he was not actively involved in the process. The association approached the court with a view to set aside the decision and to give its members the right to re-use the route. Rantaung said efforts were made in vain to ask Tshwane metro police officers to accompany his members to reclaim their operating space at the Bloed Street Taxi Rank. Senkubuge said it was important to note that the city council’s department was not mandated to handle the operating licences. However, she said for the impasse to be solved amiably it would take the co-operation of her department and its provincial counterpart. “In order to sort this out amiably we will have to work closely with the department to see how we can facilitate the project by giving them back their route. “The important thing that will have to happen is to get the province involved so that everybody is aware to whom the road belongs,” she said.
