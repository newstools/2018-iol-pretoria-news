“A case was opened and there will be investigations. Information on whether or not she was abducted by foreign nationals will be verified,” police spokesperson Captain Anton Breedt said. “According to information that I got, the girl was found after being recognised by a family member in town. The person informed the police.” The 14-year-old from Gezina went missing on Freedom Day, and was found in the Pretoria CBD a week ago. The Grade 8 pupil was on her way to visit a friend when she went missing. Her disappearance received a lot of attention on social media. Posts of her being reunited with her mother Sibongile Zinganto were also shared on social media, with a video of mother and daughter embracing and sobbing loudly. In another video posted by the #NotInMyNameSA campaign, Zinganto thanked people for the support and help offered. “I would like to thank the group #NotInMyNameSA; police were not willing to help me find my daughter so they availed themselves. “The child was found, but we are calling on police to work hard because Sinesipho said it was a lot of them (who were held hostage). The captors made marks on them in order to identify them and continued holding them captive in one way or another,” Zinganto said. Sinesipho returned with a visible mark, allegedly made by the kidnappers, on her forehead, her mother said. Her aunt Nomfundo Pitso told the Pretoria News the teenager was recovering from the trauma and receiving counselling. “We are with her at home and she’s doing okay, but she’s receiving counselling and has not yet returned to school. She was found by a family friend,” Pitso said. “We don’t know what happened to her or where she was.”
