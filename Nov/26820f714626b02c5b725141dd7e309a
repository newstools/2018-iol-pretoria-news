The warning comes after a man, believed to be between the ages of 34 and 38, was killed after being hit by a car along the R21 and Solomon Mahlangu Drive in Pretoria on Wednesday morning. Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the man was hit by a car at 8.05am and died on the spot. The driver and passenger in the vehicle sustained minor injuries and were treated on the scene. “The accident occurred along one of our main roads, and we have been saying that we don't want pedestrians on the freeways, as these are busy roads. “We have launched an operation, which started last month, to arrest pedestrians found crossing on main roads,” he said. Mahamba said pedestrians were a source of danger on the road, and thus not wanted anywhere near freeways. He said: “The operation was launched during October Transport Month, and will be carried through the festive season and beyond.” At the scene of the accident, a witness said the victim was known in the area, and was mentally challenged. “The guy is someone we were used to seeing every day as he usually walked around looking for food and asking for money.” Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane said pedestrian fatalities were a big problem; about 30% of pedestrians died while they crossed freeways and other major roads each year. “Some people cross the road under the influence of alcohol and due to that they are not attentive to what happens on the road. Even so, there are a lot of interventions done to ensure the fatalities do not occur,” he said.
