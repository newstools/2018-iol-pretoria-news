Phelelani Jojisa, 32, from Mayville, appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate’s Court before being remanded in custody pending another appearance tomorrow. He cut a lone figure in the dock wearing a blue T-shirt with what looked like a blood stain. His sister, Nontethelelo, wept outside court, telling journalists that her younger brother was no criminal or hooligan. In fact Jojisa supports Kaizer Chiefs’ arch-rival Orlando Pirates. Thus he had no reason to invade the pitch unlike the other fans who were allegedly angered by the 2-0 loss their team had suffered to Free State Stars, she said. “The State needs to look for and arrest the real culprits. It is the Kaizer Chiefs fans who did this; Phelelani is no criminal,” she said. The accused’s cousin, Nhlanhla Gwija, who was also in court said he was equally confused by the arrest of his relative. The family had spent the entire Saturday night and Sunday trying to locate Phelelani and only learnt yesterday that he had been arrested. “According to the people who were with him at the stadium he had gone on to the pitch while trying to escape the chaos in the stands. He has no business with Chiefs,” Gwija said. Initially, police had said two people had been arrested in connection with the incident but Phelelani was the only one to appear in court. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said charges against the other suspect had been withdrawn because that suspect  could not be linked to the case. Naicker said the police were working around the clock to identify and bring the perpetrators of the violence to book.
