Khoza’s opponents, Mpho Ramakatsa and Lufuno Gogoro, insisted the pair were not only members but helped establish the party. They recently called for Khoza to resign as ADeC leader. The outspoken former ANC MP announced her retirement from politics on Saturday, barely four months after the launch of ADeC. ADeC national board organiser Nathaniel Bricknell said Ramakatsa and Gogoro were rejected admission as members because of their tendency to hop between political parties and trying to "to take over". Ramakatsa left the ANC after taking it to court, leading to the dissolution of the Free State executive committee in 2012. He was axed from the EFF in 2015. Gogoro had been with the IFP, ANC, EFF and Black First, Land First (BLF) before he tried his luck with the ADeC, where he claimed to be its ­national co-ordinator. “There is no disciplinary action against Makhosi, they can't walk into ADeC declare themselves members and discipline members, that is unheard of. We have sent them letters that they desist from using the name of the party,” said Bricknell. Ramakatsa confirmed receiving the letter but said he did not recognise the structure that sent it. “I was part of the consultation processes that led to the founding conference where we agreed to form a political party yet a board of an NGO is sending me letters,” he said. According to Ramakatsa, Khoza registered the party as an non-governmental organisation (NGO) without consulting party leadership. But Bricknell said an NGO was registered as a holding body for ADeC before the political party was launched and members knew this. “The purpose of this was to ensure transparency in party funding and the auditing process, and we remain a political party as such, registered with the IEC, and will partake in elections,” he said. He denied that Ramakatsa and Gogoro were founding members of ADeC. Khoza could not be reached for comment.
