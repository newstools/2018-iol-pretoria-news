They co-chaired a session titled, "Our Actions Count: Community mobilisation model and transforming inaction in response to stigma and discrimination into action” at the event. The conference is held under the theme Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges. This satellite session focused on a stigma reduction project that the Soul City Institute and the SA National Aids Council have been implementing in South Africa. The session also shared the rationale behind the project, the process of developing the programme and some of the lessons learnt during implementation. The International Aids Conference is the largest conference on any global health issue in the world. First convened during the peak of the Aids epidemic in 1985, it still provides a unique forum for the intersection of science, advocacy, and human rights. Each conference is an opportunity to strengthen policies and programmes that ensure an effective response to the HIV epidemic. Known as Aids 2018, the conference provides 18000 delegates with the latest HIV research, and an opportunity to reflect on key issues facing both the HIV sector and the broader global health community. The conference is hosted by the International Aids Society, the world’s largest association of HIV professionals, with members from more than 180 countries. Its members include researchers, clinicians, policy and programme planners, and public health and community practitioners. On Monday, Deputy President David Mabuza and Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi led a strong South African delegation to the conference, which ends tomorrow. Mabuza then returns home to join President Cyril Ramaphosa as South Africa hosts the 10th BRICS Summit, which opened yesterday in Joburg. - Staff Reporter
