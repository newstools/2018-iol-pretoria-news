The rights group blatantly emphasised that it would not be bullied by acting chief executive of the DLCA Collins Letsoalo, who is also chief financial officer of the Department of Transport. #NotInMyName president Siya Jentile accused Letsoalo of trying to intimidate them from representing the workers. “We are not going to be intimidated; we are not going to allow the ordinary citizens of South Africa to be bullied,” he told a media briefing in Mamelodi yesterday. Jentile said their call was clear: the DLCA should deal with the matter as well as the backlog. They also planned to get the court interdict they were issued with last week rescinded. Jentile said he had told Letsoalo that the best way to address the matter was to allow the dismissed employees to return to work to ramp up production. “His response was that he had already opened a criminal case against them and could therefore not countenance their return.” #NotInMyName secretary-general Themba Masango said they would fight to the bitter end. “We are are ready for whatever comes our way” he told the Pretoria News. The DLCA workers produce about 450000 licence cards a month. The employees said that when the department took over Prodiba in 2015, those who had worked for the company since 1998 were transferred to the DLCA. They said they felt threatened and accused Letsoalo of ruling the company with an iron fist, and refusing to negotiate a decent contract. The workers said they would seek court action to ensure that staff were allowed back to work. The department had yet to comment.
