VIRGILATTE GWANGWA 
virgilatte.gwangwa@inl.co.za AMAZED, excited and scared are a few of the mixed emotions that the first time students are currently going through at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU) in Ga-Rankuwa today.
 
The emotions come after thousands of  first year students from all corners of the country attend their orientation day programme at the university. Speaking to the Pretoria News before the programme started, students said they were not clear what to expect but hoped to learn more about their course and what is expected of them. "I know today is just orientation day but I can't shake off the weird feeling in my stomach. I am happy that I am here and cannot wait to start with my academic year, " said Khensani Hlatshwayo.

Deputy vice-chancellor for research, postgraduate studies and innovation, Professor Olalekan Ayo-Yusuf told students they chose the best health sciences institution that meets the health needs of the country's population at large. He said: "You being here should tell you that you are unique, you have been selected among many, have fun and enjoy your time here. But I must warn you, you are going to have so much fun that you won't want to leave this place. Ayo-Yusuf told students if their qualification took three years to complete, they must study and leave in record time. He said as much as SMU was fun, there was more much fun to be had outside campus. Students danced and participated in other fun activities in the hall.
