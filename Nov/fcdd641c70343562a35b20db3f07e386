Illegal land invaders in Morula View, Mabopane will still be evicted despite the City missing a promised September deadline due to procedural delays. This was revealed by MMC for Agricultural and Environmental Management, Mike Mkhari who intervened when Morula View residents clashed with invaders who built shacks on an an open space in their community. The community started complaining that despite several engagement with the City, the shacks stood firm, depreciating the value of their property investments. The invaders had told their furious neighbours that if they could not tolerate shacks near their houses, they could relocate to Sandton. Mkhari said: “I have given Morula View residents my word that the City is determined to remove all illegal shacks erected in their community and across the rest of the City. A contractor was appointed and we are just waiting for the Tshwane metro police department to submit a report to the mayoral committee. “The report will deal with the issues of funding the execution of the evictions. This is going to cost millions because evictions will take place across all of Tshwane in other areas like Atteridgeville, Soshanguve, Ga-Rankuwa and Mamelodi to mention a few.” The invaders had erected over 60 shacks in the community and some were left empty as threats of eviction loomed. Another group supporting land grabbing joined the shack dwellers and expressed plans to invade the empty space behind the ODI stadium. Ward councillor Tshepo Motaung said land invaders refused to follow the housing procedure because they were led by people who wanted to sell stands for profit. MMC Mkhari said some of the people behind land invasions drove luxurious cars and didn’t qualify for RDP houses because of their high earnings.
