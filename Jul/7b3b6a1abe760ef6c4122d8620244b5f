They suspect the man, found in the bush, could have died in his sleep. Pathologists found the remains still covered in a blanket. Next to his remains was an old fireplace, clothes and cooking equipment. Pathologists and police officers came out of the bushes carrying the remains in a plastic bag. Residents who had gathered there said they were surprised that there was hardly any smell in the vicinity. They suspected the man had died a while ago. Yunus Fredericks, a resident in the area, said he discovered the remains after seeing a skull that had separated from the rest of the covered body. He then called for help. “I discovered the remains afternoon when I was helping my son to catch birds. He saw a bird near the remains and said we must have a closer look. We were just going to look at the bird; we did not expect to find what we did. “When I got closer to the remains, I saw a plastic bag with clothes and soon realised there was a skull nearby. I ran to call for help, but at that time there was not even a bad smell. “I could only smell something when the investigators uncovered the remains. At that time I saw only bones. According to the forensic experts, it’s was an older person,” said Yunus. Investigators planned to conduct a DNA test to identify the victim and possibly find family or relatives. Eersterust Concerned Residents chairman and secretary Curt Williams and Liesl Myburgh said the bushes had been a problem for a while because people hardly ever walked there. They said this was the second person found dead around the area in a couple of years. Pretoria News
