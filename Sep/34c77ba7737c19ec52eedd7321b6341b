Hosted by the Soul City Institute for Social Justice in partnership with the EU, the event was aimed at presenting the findings of community-based monitoring conducted by young women within the Raising Voices programme. Girls from different provinces told representatives from government sectors that a lot had to be done to ensure that women were safe in their communities. Mbali Mashele from Mpumalanga said communities were without street lights. Owing to that, a lot of young women were harassed and raped. “It takes something as simple as a street light that’s not working to put a woman in danger. We would like the government to do something about it. This might seem like a simple thing but it poses a danger to us. We would like to live in a society where we don’t constantly question our safety,” she said. Lato Mabaso from the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs said: “We live in a world where gender inequality remains an issue. "Due to that, we have gender mainstream policy frameworks which we have presented to municipalities. “It is with these policies that we tell councillors to go back to basics and start fixing street lights, cut grass because if the grass is high it becomes a perfect hiding spot for criminals.” Those present, however, told Mabaso that frameworks in municipalities was a waste of time as they were not implemented.
