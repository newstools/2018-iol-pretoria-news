Tickets were sold out yesterday. The recording follows the success of his debut album titled Melodi in his mother tongue Sepedi, which garnered him a huge following. The recording will feature local gospel breakout artist Putuma Tiso as well as Kgaugelo Kekana, Cornelius Maphoto, Prophet Marcus Maloma and Psalmist Sefako. Maloma said he chose to feature local acts for his recording because he wanted to pave the way for their careers the same way other gospel greats gave him a platform when he was featured on their albums before going solo. “I want to afford other gospel artists a similar stage to shine as I was given before breaking into the industry. As Pretoria artists we need to stand together. “It’s time we promoted more local artists. Their success will be my success. Hopefully we can inspire big artists from other genres and promoters to always consider local artists before booking Joburg acts." Kekana, meanwhile, said she was excited about performing at the State Theatre. She also thanked Maloma for affording local artists an opportunity. “Fans can expect to see a great performance and get food for the soul,” she said. Maloma has been busy with rehearsals and promises a spiritually fired performance. He said the CD would be ready for release at the end of next month. He urged fans to turn out in their numbers. “I don’t take for granted the unwavering support from my fans, churches and fellow musicians. Gospel music has shaped my life. It gives me great pleasure to do the same for others." - Staff Reporter
