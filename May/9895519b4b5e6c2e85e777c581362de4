The young engineers entertained a large crowd with their autonomous cars at the university’s annual Robot Car Race Day. The cars raced on a track with different coloured lines that could be detected by lasers. To score points, the cars had to accurately follow a green line that made its way to the finish point. Student racetrack official Anita Notico said: “These students designed these cars from the beginning of the year in teams. Today, they showed us that they are really good at what they do. Their cars were programmed to follow a green line that made numerous weird turns. This is what we call micro-control at its best.” The university said people who thought engineers were geeks whose only exposure to ultraviolet radiation was through fluorescent lights in the lab couldn’t be more wrong. It described engineers as thinkers and tinkers who could get quite absorbed in their inventions. The university described them as a subspecies of homo sapiens who are intimately connected to the world through an understanding of nature and science that allows for the creation of the technology that supports civilisation. Team MegaDrifters, comprising Muhammed Omar Carrim, Reece Volker, Mahamed Ameen Omar and Dovolas Healy, said programming the robotic vehicles was the most challenging part of their course. They jokingly said the module should be a high-credit module due to all the extra effort they had been forced to put in. The students said the project would help them obtain rewarding and lucrative careers, as a lot of graduates became computer engineers and programmers, and they, too, could take that path.
