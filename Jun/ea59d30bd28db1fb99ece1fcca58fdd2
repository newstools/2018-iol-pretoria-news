Pretoria - From being a Nyaope addict, to sleeping in sewer pipes, to serving some time in prison, to surviving cancer and turning over a new leaf to complete the Comrades Marathon – on one leg, using two crutches. Xolani Luvuno is living proof that not all heroes need a cape. The 34-year-old had a sit down with Pretoria News reporter Sakhile Ndlazi to explain how he felt on Sunday during the gruelling 89km marathon.

Venter was immediately touched by his approach and took him to his home. He gave him clean clothes, food and a bed. Venter asked one of his employees to find a room to rent for Luvuno in Mamelodi. “I saw something in him. He is my boy,” said Venter, beaming with pride. Venter got Luvuno off drugs and gave him a job at his perfume company Sunbird perfumes, and finally got him into running He helped Luvuno break his addiction to Nyaope and got him addicted to running instead. Luvuno said finishing the race was an achievement he had never imagined would become a reality.
