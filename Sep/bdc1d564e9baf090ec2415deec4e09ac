Band leader, composer, vocalist and saxophonist, Dr Sundar Viswanathan yesterday encouraged music lovers to get ready to experience something out of the ordinary. “The music that I write is about the journey that I have travelled, so audiences can expect to experience more than just music,” he said. The ensemble is known for its eclectic style of music - hard bop jazz, rock, Brazilian lyricism, electronica, atmospheric textures and ambiance, Javanese gamelan, and contemporary improvisation. “We’re very excited to share our music with audiences in South Africa. I’m sure that the optimism and spiritual energy of the people here will provide the perfect environment for us to present our musical vision. We hope that all those who attend our concerts will enjoy and be transported by our performances.” The ensemble has already performed at the Olympia Bakery and the Labia Theatre in Cape Town. Viswanathan said so far the feedback has been positive. “The audience in Cape Town told us that they enjoyed the music and that they felt as though they were being transported through a journey that we have travelled.” Although it is the first time that the band performs in the country, Viswanathan has been in the country before and performed with some local musicians. He said: “I know this country loves and appreciates good music. Hence, I made a lot of contacts when I was here years ago to ensure that the band can come and perform.” The band will perform at the State Theatre at 8pm tomorrow as well as at Unisa on Saturday. Tickets at the door or Computicket for R110 and R250.
