The event was held at the Russian Ballet Academy of South Africa at Doringkloof Mall in Centurion. Learn to Fly founder Claire Gardiner said: “This day is a tribute to our guests, and our girls were treated to some fine ballet performances by other dancers.” The dancers performed dances from different countries, including Russia, Spain and Belarus. Posture, smile, twist, twirls and turns were the order of the day. While some mastered the tip-toeing technique, others perfected the splits and jumps with great composure. At the end, the Learn to Fly dancers got a chance to show off their skill too. Tinyiko Manganye, 8, said she enjoyed every minute of the show, and what stood out for her was Zaniah McCoy’s performance. “I just loved how Zaniah mixed African dance with ballet; that was so beautiful to watch,”  she said. The Learn to Fly initiative was made up of girls from Irene Middle School. Gardiner said the initiative aimed at taking disadvantaged girls off the streets and avoiding life’s hardships. She said that with the programme she wanted to show girls that not only could they reach their goals through academics, but arts and culture as well.
