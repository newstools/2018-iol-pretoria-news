The protests began after two college students were killed in an accident on Dhaka’s Airport Road on July 29. Yesterday, students of various schools and colleges started controlling traffic in Dhaka for the eighth consecutive day. By 1pm (7am GMT), thousands of university students were taking part in the demonstration, witnesses said. Students were holding a sit-in at Jigatola intersection and chanting slogans like, “We want justice!” when police started firing tear gas shells. “It was a peaceful rally, but suddenly police fired tear gas shells aimed at us (that) left several injured,” Mohammad Atikur Rahman, one of the protesters, said. A number of journalists were also beaten and had their cameras taken away by ruling party members at the site of the protest. Transport workers have suspended services, fearing for their safety and the possibility of damage to their vehicles. No long-route buses departed or entered the city, leaving Dhaka essentially isolated from the rest of the country. According to police, about 3000 people die every year in road crashes across the country. But the private organisation Bangladesh Commuters’ Welfare Association said at least 7397 people were killed last year. It is common in Bangladesh for people to drive vehicles without a valid licence. In the past week a number of police and government officials were found lacking proper documents after being confronted by protesters. - dpa/African News Agency (ANA)
