DURBAN – The Ithala board of directors has appointed Pearl Sizeka Bengu as new group chief executive of Ithala Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) with effect from November 1. For the past months, the Ithala board of directors has been looking for an appropriate person capable of taking over the reins of the IDFC. Ithala is one of the main drivers of economic development in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and a strategic enabler of support for the province's historically disadvantaged communities. According to the board, they had actively engaged with the new chief executive and believe that she will be able to lead the organisation making sure that it continues to pursue clean and efficient corporate governance and pushes economic development in KZN.
