The 76-year-old Lynnwood resident said he then stopped collecting for a long time, but just after he qualified as a doctor in 1976, he resumed again. “Yes, it has been a long time; it keeps me busy. “I have been retired for about nine years and I do not think I have been bored a single day.” Dove has a cardboard full of thousands of stamps he intends to show to his grandchildren one day. “Collecting teaches you many things. My little granddaughter likes the stamps because she can tear them up.” Dove said he has the whole collection of stamps from the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei homelands. “When I heard South Africa was going to become a democratic country, I knew that they were going to dissolve the homelands. “I then made sure I bought all the stamps. Had I not done it, it would've been a void in my collection.” To collect a series takes him about four months of research. “I exhibited the 'When Pretoria Was Young' collection four years ago and got a gold medal for it. I have put in more extensive material now and increased the collection by an additional 16 pages,” he said. Dove said there were definitive stamps used on a daily basis at the Post Office, commemorative stamps for a short period of time, postal history and postal cards. “I like the postcards very much because they are easy to see when you get to my age, when one's eyesight is not always the best anymore. It is nice sometimes to see something that big.” He also encouraged young people to collect stamps. “Stamps can be expensive. That said, young people rather wants gadgets, but they are missing out. The whole objective of this is to create something that is interesting, constructive and also teaches people to think about history.” Dove’s 'When Pretoria Was Young' collection will be on display at the Philatelic Society Stamp Show at the historic KleinKaap Boutique Hotel in Centurion from October 17 to 20. He has been part of the society for well over 25 years.
