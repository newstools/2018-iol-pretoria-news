The THF provides care for hundreds who live on the city streets, temporarily or permanently. The events last week, which included local universities and the City of Tshwane, included a clean-up campaign, awareness rally and a short formal programme with presentations. Little did the organisers know they were in for a surprise gift, said Tebogo Mpufane. The money will go to the running costs of the organisation, which serves this vulnerable community, including administration and awareness projects which will hopefully bring in further donations. Mpufane said: â€œThe donation came as a shock, as we had previously held a meeting with the City, and the matter of a donation did not come up." The forum calls on everyone in the city to join religious leaders, non-profit organisations and academics in supporting the work that it does. The Tshwane Homelessness Forum said statistics of homelessness present a picture of how bad things are. Whereas in the village people could plant food, this was more difficult in the city where people live hand to mouth.
