They were assisted by University of Pretoria - or Tuks - engineering students from the MakerSpace Centre to build and code their own robot. The 50cm x 50cm robot was handed to the team to dismantle, practice on and redesign, based on MakerSpaceâ€™s advice for the competition. They were required to reassemble their unit and test its connectivity, software and mechanics to ensure it was functional in front of a crowd of other young scientists. Then the robot was given two and a half minutes to select the best energy options by placing boxes in corresponding areas. This would activate the chosen energy source, and in some instances mechanisms such as the wind turbine crank needed to be activated. Team South Africa, nicknamed The Springbots, also won the Walt Disney award for imagination and creativity for having the most creative approach to problem-solving. This was because of their performance in the qualifying round, during which they collected the most points ever scored in a qualifying round against previous record-holder Team Venezuela. MakerSpace Centre said the group of engineering students started mentoring the team in July, training them in how to build and code a functional and competition-ready robot.
