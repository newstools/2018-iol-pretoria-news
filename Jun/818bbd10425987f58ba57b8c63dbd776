Japie Bosman said he was at the beer festival for the atmosphere and meeting new people. “It’s my third time coming here. The highlight is the variety of beer and food stalls to kickstart my Father’s Day weekend.” Japie tried all from mouth-watering burgers to hot wings. The gates opened at 10am, but at that time the parking was full. Scores of people were coming in. At the entrance beer glass tokens were handed out to try out the more than 40 brewers. Lesego Baloyi had a difficult time choosing which craft beer was his favourite. The Firestone Karaoke Kombi was a huge drawcard. One was a classic 1972 VW Brasília kombi and the other a brand new version converted into a mobile karaoke studio.
