Pretoria - A convoy of Uber and Taxify drivers took to the streets of Tshwane heading to Uber offices in Menlyn to raise grievances ahead of the expected petrol hike. They gathered at the open grounds on Soutpansberg Road in Rietondale on Tuesday morning after deciding to shutdown operations. They wanted to send a message to Uber and Taxify. The e-hailing operators claimed that Uber and Taxify were not willing to raise trip costs while the increasing cost of petrol and diesel continued to shrink their "meagre" profits. The drivers controlled traffic at intersections for easy passage. They blocked several intersections, leaving numerous motorists stationary for ages.

They are going to handover a memorandum to Uber officials but they doubt it will be accepted. They said Uber continuously refused to speak to them in groups, claiming they only speakÂ to individuals. The drivers also want the e-hailing companies to increase their trip flat rates from a minimum of R20 to R50. They said the cost of living has been rising and they were now operating at a loss. Uber is expected to issue a statement in response to the protest and will later respond to claims that the company unfairly dismissed a driver. Uber said the company did not deactivate drivers without a reason. The convoy moved along Lynnwood Road crossing the N1 highway towards Menlyn. Pretoria News
