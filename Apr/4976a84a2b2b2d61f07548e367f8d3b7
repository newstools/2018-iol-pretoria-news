“In the boxing game, you win one round and you lose one round, but in the end, somebody gives the knockout (blow). This (defeat) is not a knockout; this is part of the process and I will continue to fight for fairness and for justice,” said De Lille in a statement. She added that councillors who had voted against her had done so for their job security. “It is clear that councillors voted with their stomachs and represented their jackets. I asked councillors whether they discussed the motion of no confidence and whether they had a mandate from their branches. “Councillors are not in council as individuals; they represent constituencies and I asked whether the councillors received a mandate from the people they represent. “Over the past eight months I have received thousands of messages of support from residents across Cape Town, so it is clear that this motion was driven by individuals’ feelings and not the public’s will. “Be that as it may, I will make representations to the DA federal executive (fedex), as I understand this to be the next step in the process,” said De Lille. Soon after the vote, DA deputy caucus leader JP Smith said: “The caucus in Cape Town conceded the motion brought forward by councillor (Angus) McKenzie, a motion of no confidence in the leader of the DA caucus A vote took place by secret ballot, the DA caucus supported the motion and is hereby requesting the fedex to remove the mayor as the leader of the caucus and as the mayor of the City of Cape Town. This result will be communicated to the fedex and the matter will be left in its hands.”
