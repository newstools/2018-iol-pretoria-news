The event was organised by the Hands of Love Foundation and brought persons living with albinism, parents, grandparents, and traditional healers organisations together to call for an end to the stigma attached to people living with the genetic condition. Foundation chairperson Matshidiso Selemela said awareness was crucial as the condition was still marred by stigma and myths. As such, the organisation was reaching out to the community to provide them with information but also encouraging those living with the genetic condition to follow their dreams. Selemela said misunderstandings and lack of education were the main reason behind attacks and killings on the albinism community that were still continuing to this day. “People still believe persons with albinism are rich or can be used as a charm to get rich. They believe they disappear and have special powers because they look different.” She said involvement from the government and other stakeholders was lacking severely, hence the movement was moving at such a slow pace. Zandi Nkosi Bangoma, or Gogo Somhlolo, of the Sesiyakhula Njalo NPO said they were representing traditional healers. She said they wanted to address the stigma that healers used body parts of persons living with albinism. Gogo Somhlolo said traditional healers healed people and were not out to cause harm. For that reason they attended the event to send out the message that this shall not happen in their name. “There are some of us who are healers and don’t use body parts; and yes there are witches who go out of their way to misinform people. “We want to join forces with the albinism community to say we will support and protect them because they are people with the same blood as all of us.”
