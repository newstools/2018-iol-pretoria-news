However, he cannot make it past the reception desk at any hospital because he does not have an ID. The 64-year-old from Rietfontein has been without an ID since a house robbery two and a half years ago. He told the Pretoria News that at the time, robbers took his wallet, ID book, driving licence and everything of value. Since the robbery, the frail man has been without an ID despite countless trips to Home Affairs and filling in numerous forms. “I was born in Greece, but I have been in South Africa since I was 9. I had my ID, but I have been running around like I never had it before. They say I am a foreigner, but I have been here all my life. “Right now my health is not good. I am sick but cannot go to any public hospital because the first thing they want from me is an ID, which I do not have, and without it I cannot be assisted,” he said. Without an ID, Piagalis said he felt like a leaf easily taken by the wind as he could not do anything, let alone get medical assistance or apply for social grant. He said: “I honestly don't know what the Home Affairs in Pretoria central wants me to do. I filled in all the forms they wanted me to. I received a reference number a long time ago, but every time I go there I have to fill in the same forms for the same application.” Having failed to get assistance, volunteers stepped in and tried to assist him, but they too failed dismally. They took Piagalis to the Home Affairs in Akasia with a letter from Council for the Aged requesting that he gets assisted. But that too did not help, and he was told to go back to the offices in the CBD. Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said the department had instituted an investigation into the matter.
