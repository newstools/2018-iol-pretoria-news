The game will start at 6pm instead of 8pm as Uefa rules stipulate no European club can play at the same time as the Europa League final that will kick off at 8.45pm. The timing of the match will put a strain on the traffic flow of what is expected to be a sold-out event with many people knocking off at 5pm from work - an hour before kick-off. “We are paranoid about the safety of our people,” said Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe. “I’ve had some mineworkers saying they aren’t working on Wednesday. “It’s very important that we ensure people’s safety. This is for Madiba (as part of the Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations). We will announce the measures we’ve put in place to ensure people are safe and easily access the stadium.” Motsepe announced the match yesterday in Sandton. The panel making the announcement included Energy Minister Jeff Radebe who leads the inter-ministerial committee handling the Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu centenary celebrations. Sport and Recreation Minister Tokozile Xasa was also part of the panel that featured Tokyo Sexwale who was representing the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Safa president Danny Jordaan and La Liga Africa director Antonio Barradas. “This event couldn’t have come at a better time,” Radebe said. “We are celebrating the birth of the founding father of our constitutional democracy, Nelson Mandela under the theme ‘be the legacy’. “We are also celebrating the centenary of Mama Sisulu, one of the shining examples of our Struggle who dedicated her life to the service of her people, under the theme, ‘a woman of fortitude’. “The globalisation of the icon Mandela couldn’t have been done better than the soccer exhibition that will be displayed by the two teams, each one a drawer of crowds, a displayer of style and consistency, following in the footsteps of Mandela in uniting people across regions and continents. The 2018 Comrades Marathon will also be dedicated to Mandela.” See Sport
