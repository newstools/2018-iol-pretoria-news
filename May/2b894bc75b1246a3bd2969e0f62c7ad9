From the street it does not look like much, but this 1930s building was described by architect and historian Albrecht Holm as reminding one of a world of magic. The atmospheric theatre - the first in the city and only the second in South Africa - was designed in the  Italian Renaissance style, similar to the Rome Capitol Theater in New York. It’s name is often misspelt as Capital. When you enter the building, you need to close your eyes to the dereliction and imagine the time when the well-heeled of Pretoria dressed up and visited the grand old dame to watch a movie. The 2 000-seat theatre with its balcony and ornate interior decorations, including golden columns and a roof studded with stars, was designed by architect P Roger Cooke. The building never had a façade, as it was never completed. The theatre was opened by then prime minister, General JBM Hertzog in 1931.  The programme from the opening night expressed the hope that “people of Pretoria would ‘forget the worry and care of everyday life upon entering through magic portals into a world of make-believe’ since ‘we are all but grown-up children’”. Sound pictures; dramatic performances and classical music were presented at the Capitol which remained a gathering point until the 1970s. Now however, it gathers dust as a parking garage. But even though it has been in disuse for decades, stepping into this grand old theatre and its majestic foyer,  one can still imagine the luxurious times which were had here by the patrons. Entrance is free and it is definitely a must-see if you’re in the CBD.
