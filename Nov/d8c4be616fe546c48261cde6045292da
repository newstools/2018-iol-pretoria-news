Concerned about not having a salary, she never took a break from work, and now further treatments lie ahead. But a Good Samaritan came to her rescue yesterday and donated enough money to last her 10 months, which will also allow her time to recuperate. Mkhonza, 52, was overwhelmed when Jacaranda FM's Good Morning Angels team, from the breakfast show with Martin Bester, arrived at her Paljas Kleuterskool, Elarduspark workplace to give her some great news. This was in the form of R50000 from AskAfrika, which will assist her journey of fighting breast cancer and keeping her family financially afloat. Mkhonza could hardly string a sentence together when she got the news. “I'm very happy and it really means a lot to me. I'm happy that I'm going to get some time to rest and focus on getting better without worrying about money. “I am still in pain, but I love my job and the kids so much; that's why I'm still here,” she said. AskAfrika sales and marketing director Mashudu Ndopa said: “The fact that she carried on working through the pain is truly commendable. She really is a strong woman and you can see it by just looking at her.” It all started when parent Stephanie Conradie wrote to the show on behalf of the preschool. In the letter, Conradie described Mkhonza as a wonderful woman who loved children dearly. Conradie said the school could unfortunately not afford to pay Mkhonza's salary and hire someone on a temporary basis while she was away, but appealed to any listeners in a position to help her for support, so she could recover without financial concerns. Conradie said she was excited that the team came through for Mkhonza. The crèche has agreed that Mkhonza will go on leave for six months.
