The concert, which was free to the public, brought together a number of African choirs participating in the games, including those from Tshwane, Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Gabon and Kenya. The event, hosted by mayor Solly Msimanga, was in keeping with the World Choir Games theme of social cohesion and building bridges through music - “Various voices: one harmony”. It also coincided with the countdown to the celebration of Nelson Mandela Day next Wednesday. Instead of an entrance fee, concertgoers were asked to donate blankets, shoes or toiletry bags for those in need in the city. The programme included choral music genres and dance. Among those on stage were the Tshwane University of Technology choir; Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences choir; Hendrik Verwoerd and Pretoria High School for Girls choirs. In honour of Mandela, there was a rendition titled Madiba, composed by Tshwane's composer, conductor and an adjudicator for the World Choir Games, Mohau Mogale. Msimanga, thanking everyone for their donations, said: “It's winter now, and most of us came here with big jackets to keep us warm, but some don't have any of that.” Yesterday, the Open Repertoire competition took place at the State Theatre. Further rounds of the games continue tomorrow.
