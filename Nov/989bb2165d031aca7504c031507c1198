Yesterday, EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi reminded Gigaba in the National Assembly that apologies and explanations aside, it was not only social media that remained unforgiving. Ndlozi said ministers should use camera-less cellphones and avoid recording themselves, referring to Gigaba’s leaked sex tape. Gigaba showed Ndlozi his pinkie finger. Never mind what he meant, but the big question is, what has become of our Parliament? Ndlozi had no business pulling the phone stunt in the House - and as for Gigaba’s response, no words. EFF leader Julius Malema then declared that no white person would speak in the house - and this is more than two decades into democracy. As if that was not enough, there was a scuffle involving Agang SA MP Andries Tlouamma and EFF’s Nazier Paulsen. House chairperson Thoko Didiza said she would refer the matters to Speaker Baleka Mbete. We hope severe action will be taken against those found guilty of behaviour best described as disgusting, childish, vulgar and unacceptable. In the Gauteng legislature, the controversial GladAfrica tender was thrust into the spotlight. And you’ve got to love the explanation given by the EFF for the ANC’s criticism of DA-led metros. According to the EFF, the issue was more about the kickbacks the ANC used to get from tenders when it was in power. Could it be that the big secret has now finally be revealed? Happy Wednesday, Pretoria...
