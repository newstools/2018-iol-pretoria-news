She will perform two shows at the TicketPro Dome on July 18 and 20. Ticket pre-sales are open to Discovery members, and public sales open at Computicket tomorrow. On Twitter, Perry said she was “over the moon to be performing there (SA) for the first time, can’t wait to C U all”, she said. Perry’s tour follows her musical journey, and includes mega-hits up to her latest album. Perry sang in church as a child and was a gospel singer before branching into pop rock. Her rise to fame came 10 years ago with the release of her second album, One of the Boys, and its singles I Kissed a Girl and Hot *  Cold were huge hits. This was followed by the disco-style album Teenage Dream which produced five number 1 songs - California Gurls, Teenage Dream, Firework, ET, and Last Friday Night (TGIF)”. Last year’s Witness was her fifth album and also topped the US charts, with its most successful single being Chained to the Rhythm. The Witness tour started in September last year and comes to South Africa from the UK. - Staff Reporter
