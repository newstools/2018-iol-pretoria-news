This is the appeal of the City of Tshwane as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains take part in the five-day Diwali celebration. Yesterday Tshwane officials asked the Hindu community to ensure they adhered to municipality by-laws when lighting fireworks. Emergency Services spokesperson Johan Pieterse said any private use of fireworks needed to first be approved by the department. Any application would be considered by the Fire Safety Section for the private discharge of fireworks on premises, he said. Requirements included that the area where the fireworks were to be discharged had to be at least 100m from buildings, roads and railway lines. The area must be at least 20m from telephone lines, power lines, trees and overhead obstructions. Fireworks must be discharged with a distance extending 50m from the front and to the sides and be clear of people, he said. It must be kept clear for falling residue from aerial fireworks to a distance of at least 100m. Pieterse said those wishing to use fireworks were encouraged to apply to the City, or the Emergency Service Station 1 on Bosman Street in the CBD. Applicants are required to submit a sketch plan of the grounds on which the fireworks will be discharged. This must indicate the nearest building, roads, railway line, telephone lines, power lines, trees, refreshment area and where the fireworks are to be stored. “Written approval for the private discharge of fireworks will be given if it takes place on sports fields, agricultural holdings and other suitable open areas,” Pieterse said. “The City of Tshwane would also like to take this opportunity to wish all Hindu communities a blessed Diwali.” Applications should be sent to the City of Tshwane, Chief of Emergency Services, PO Box 440, Pretoria, 0001. Alternatively, apply at Emergency Services Station 1 (Bosman Street).
