Proclamation Hill residents have been left in the dark since the storm that hit the city at the weekend. And according to Nagesh Chetty, a resident, the area often has power cuts when it rains. “We know that we are going to have power outages, but it never takes them this long to get the electricity up again,” he said. Chetty and his neighbours said they called utility services member of the mayoral committee Darryl Moss, who promised the city was looking into the problem. However, four days later they were still without electricity. “It is not fair that when we fail to pay our water bills the city is quick to cut off our electricity, but when we need the power back, they take their time to fix things,” Chetty said. Moss acknowledged that residents at Proclamation Hill had a number of electricity supply issues. He said these included cable theft, vandalism of substations and equipment, overloading due to illegal connections and network instability. “We have addressed the instability issues with some upgrading. The most recent outage was caused by the huge storm. Lightning, high winds and rain resulted in more than 2 000 power outages across the city,” he said. Moss said electricity teams were working to restore power. He said most outages were resolved yesterday.
