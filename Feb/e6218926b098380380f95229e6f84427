The theme for this year is “Wetlands for a sustainable urban future”, and the annual celebration is aimed at raising awareness of the benefits and importance of wetlands as a natural resource. The benefits, Thompson said, were becoming crucial as the number of people living in cities continued to increase. “Wetlands are an important part of the ecosystem as they provide a number of benefits, not only to the natural environment but also people’s livelihoods. “Such benefits include the reduction of flooding and improved water quality, and they serve as reservoirs, filter waste, and provide urban green space,” said 
Thompson. She added that wetlands in urban areas were also important for human-related value, particularly landscape amenity and recreational purpose. However, according to the department, for many years they have been regarded as wastelands, with their vital importance and functions not fully understood. Yesterday, the Pretoria News toured Colbyn Valley Nature Area where information about the significance of the wetlands was shared with by authorities. The tour was shown a group of people employed as part of the department’s programme to ensure the wetland's safety. The department said it had a programme called Working for Wetlands which focused on rehabilitation, restoration, maintenance and protection interventions to ensure healthy wetlands. Department spokesperson Albi Modise said: “Through the department’s investment under the Working for Wetlands programme, we have improved and secured the health of more than 80000 hectares of wetland area, while providing 17575 employment opportunities. “Working for Wetlands has also provided 180753 days of training in both vocational and life skills,” Modise said. Today the world over, governments, non-governmental organisations, civil society and academia come together to celebrate the day, with the aim of creating and raising public awareness of the value of wetlands and their vital link to human well-being.
