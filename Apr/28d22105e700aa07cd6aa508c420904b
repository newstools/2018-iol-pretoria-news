But in real life, the 31-year-old woman from Soshanguve has never been married and has just two children. On finding out that she was married and had three children, Nkuna immediately turned to Home Affairs, but has yet to be assisted. According to the department, Nkuna had to get an affidavit stating that she had been married without her knowledge. Only then would the department investigate. “The woman must get an affidavit from the police stating that she has been married off without her consent. She must then visit the nearest Home Affairs office and we will institute an investigation into the matter,” departmental  spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said.  “If the outcome of the probe confirms that she is indeed married without her knowledge, we will duly update her details on our system to reflect her correct status.” Nkuna, who works as a security officer, said she was shocked to learn that she was married when she had gone to renew her Securities Industry Regulatory Authority certificate. She said she was informed her ID had been cloned. “It was in 2015 when I learntthat I was married to a 67-year-old Thomas Mathebula. I had gone to renew my certificate and when they took my fingerprints, the picture of the woman who appeared on the system was not me. I immediately went to Home Affairs in Ga-Rankuwa to enquire.” There she was advised to apply for the smart card ID, which she did, but the card was not issued. Nkuna said she was informed that the department could not issue the ID card under her surname because she was married. She said failure to renew her certificate meant she could soon lose her job as a security guard. In addition, she claimed she consistently got phone calls from retailers demanding payment on her accounts. However, she has never opened any account. “I really need help because I will soon lose my job. My employer always reminds me to update my certificate.”
