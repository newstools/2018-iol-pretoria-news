Contract manager Hein Pretorius, the senior engineer at the site of the Grayston Drive pedestrian and cyclist bridge project, testified before the inquiry that he “accepted responsibility for the collapse of the temporary works structure”. However, he told the commission that he was not in a position to determine what exactly caused the collapse. He was on leave on October 14, 2015, when the structure collapsed on the M1 highway. Pretorius testified that he was aware that projects similar to the M1/Grayston bridge project required the appointment of competent persons. Asked by presiding commissioner Phumudzo Maphaha if a mentor had been assigned to Oliver Aadnesgaard, a candidate engineer at the time and the Temporary Works Supervisor of the structure, Pretorius said did not know who Aadnesgaard’s mentor was, but he was satisfied that he met the requirements of a competent person. Another concern Maphaha raised was that the drawings for the structure had no loadings indicated or calculations and were not signed. Pretorius straddled his responses between trusting what was supplied to him by FormScaff and saying: “As per the advice of my legal representative I decline to answer as I may incriminate myself.” Legal representatives acting for Murray & Roberts, took on Maphaha regarding his method of cross-examining witnesses. Sias Reineke SC questioned Maphaha over how things were normally conducted in inquiries as he felt he was being unfair to witnesses. Maphaha cautioned Reineke over disrupting proceedings. Maphaha asked that inspection registers be submitted. The Inquiry is investigating what led to the collapse of the M1/Grayston temporary structure in October 2015 leading to the deaths of two people and injury of 19.
