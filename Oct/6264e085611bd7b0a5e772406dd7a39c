AtCampus was a finalist in the Incubated Solution category of this year’s MTN Business App of the Year Awards. The seventh annual MTN Business App of the Year Awards took place earlier this month at Sandton Convention Centre. The app had made the cut among 700 apps that had been received for the competition. Founder of AtCampus, Trinity Chauke, 22, yesterday told the Pretoria News they established the app after realising that higher education was expensive. “Not only are academic activities expensive; extras such as accommodation are also costly. This app brings a solution to different problems faced by students. “Sometimes you find that books cost more at bookshops, while students may be selling them at a cheaper rate when they don’t need them anymore,” he said. Although they did not receive a prize that night, Chauke said he was overwhelmed that their app had been recognised even before it was publicly launched. He said: “This was a big opportunity; the fact that we got recognition even when we thought it was still too soon to be out there meant a lot to us. “We still have other things that we want to do and we are also looking to officially launch the app early next year.” The AtCampus app was aimed to make students’ lives better; it enables students to list and sell items such as textbooks and electronics online. It further offers one-click access to unlimited deals and opportunities such as accommodation, student part-time jobs and internships, and buying and selling items such as textbooks, stationery, electronic gadgets and home-ware. AtCampus is incubated by TuksNovation, a technology incubator and accelerator located at the University of Pretoria. Chauke said the app had so far been downloaded numerous times, although he did not have the exact figure with him. It will be launched in January. The app can be downloaded on Google Play and App Store and is available to students across the country’s universities.
