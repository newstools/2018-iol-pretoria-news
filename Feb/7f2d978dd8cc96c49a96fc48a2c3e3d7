The evening of all things love will be held in the cosy indoor setting, to be accompanied by great music by popular musicians from across the country. Musicians lined up include Akanamali hitmaker Samthing Soweto, Vusi Nova, Ntando, Kelly Khumalo, Lasauce, Thami of Idols fame and boy band 047. Flamboyant social media star and actor Moshe Ndiki will also be at the event, to be hosted by Idols judge and radio personality Somizi Mhlongo. Event organisers Muthaland Entertainment said the event was not only for couples, but for everyone. “If you are single you might find a plus one there, if you’re in a relationship it is a great way to celebrate Valentine’s Day, and if you have been fighting with your partner, the event will be a great way to make up,” they said. Couples stand the chance to win cool prizes by dressing up in the colours of love - red and white, at the event themed “love”, and they are encouraged to be at their best as they can participate in competitions like the “best themed couple”, “cutest couple” and “longest kiss”. The “Evening of love” started in 2007, but it is the first time it comes to Pretoria. There will be a full suite experience in the VVIP hospitality lounge seating area, and tickets range from R250 to R1500.
