AfriForum lawyer advocate Gerrie Nel announced today that he will assist the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) to prosecute ANC dignitary, Thandi Modise, after scores of pigs and sheep were found dead at her farm in 2014. The NSPCA yesterday submitted documents to indicate intentions to privately prosecute Modise to the office of the director of prosecution. Nel will be assisting the organisation as a prosecutor. Nel said section 8 of the criminal procedure act enabled the anti-animal cruelty organisation to privately prosecute this kind of a case immediately after indicating intention to do so. Unlike many of the cases AfriForum intended to prosecute, Modise's case would not require the organisation to wait for a go ahead from the National Prosecuting Authority. NSPCA executive director Marcelle Meredith said the organisation responded to a complaint on July 2014 and came across one of cruellest cases of animal abuse that the animal welfare had to intervene. AfriForum explained that Modise's farm was littered with at least 50 pigs and other dead animals such as geese, ducks, sheep and goats. The surviving animals, which also included chickens, were said to have been left without food and water and were in a state of desperation before they were discovered. The NPA had indicated that it would not prosecute Modise due to insufficient evidence. However, the NSPCA has the right to privately prosecute in terms of Societies for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1993.
