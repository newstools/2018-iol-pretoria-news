This event has become a part of the community's culture and attracts at least 10000 music and entertainment lovers every year. The artists and audience were encouraged to dress up in white outfits. Founding member Nqobi Makhanya, also known as DJ Vocal, said the event's decade of growth and success was humbling. He said when it started 10 years ago, it was a gathering of friends and DJs who got together in the home of one of the founders. “The culture has grown so much that people make sure they are prepared to bring cooler boxes and gazebos to relax, have fun and watch live music performances the day after spending Christmas Day with their families. “We originally named it Cooler Boxing Day because we were basically saying come chill with us for a Cooler Boxing Day holiday. However, the people changed it to Cooler Box Day and that's what most people call it now.” The event has various sponsors who helped make it possible, including the City of Tshwane, Vodacom and South African Breweries. “The success of this show is very humbling because when we started, we did not expect this. We want to grow it further to a point where we can fill up the entire stadium and bring international artists. “We are always grateful to bring a show like this to residents of the capital, and hope they keep loving and embracing it. "We are lucky the City of Tshwane buys into our vision and understands what we are trying to do.” This year's line-up included Cassper Nyovest, Nasty C, Mlindo The Vocalist, Black Motion, Da Capo, Lady Zamar, DJ Sumbody, A-Reece and OkMalumKoolKat.
