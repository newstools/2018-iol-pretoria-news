Galane said that through the walk - Walking for a Cause with Papago - he was seeking to impact many lives within different cities in the country. He is expected to arrive at Moletjie, his ancestral home, on Friday. He will start walking from Pumulani Plaza and will make his first stop in Hammanskraal later in the day. Other stops include Modimolle, Mookgophong and Mokopane. “People are more than welcome to partake in this auspicious occasion and may contribute anything to the wellness of the underprivileged. The aim is to walk 10 hours a day from the one stop to the next, giving out incentives to the selected homes. “The moment I start walking I’ll be live on Facebook notifying people how far I am with the walk. So there is a centre in Hammanskraal where people will be waiting for me with whatever they will be donating,” he said. The walk, he said, would also be informative and would give necessary information to matric pupils regarding tertiary institution applications. “I recently did a talk at some school in Lephalale where 90% of matric pupils had not applied for space at tertiary institutions. “They also had no information about bursaries, so we also want to close that gap.” To pledge a donation, SMS Papago to 42288.
