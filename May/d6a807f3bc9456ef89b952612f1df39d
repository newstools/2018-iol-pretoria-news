Amos Maluleke allegedly used a lollipop to lure the boy to his home where he raped him before dumping his body near a shack. The boy, 8, was found with blood on his trousers, and his neck twisted. Maluleke’s alleged actions infuriated residents, who had found him hiding in the corner of his home. His sheets had blood stains on them. After hearing submissions from the State on Tuesday, the court is set to deliver its verdict on the bail tomorrow. The National Prosecuting Authority has opposed the bail bid. The State argued that Maluleke spent half of the 1990s and 2000s in prison for various crimes, including sexual assault. He had been out on parole, having been sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment in the last case. Ward 68 ANC Women’s League deputy chairperson Catherine Meyers said: “That man raped that child and threw him away as if the boy was an animal. As women and parents in Atteridgeville, we are saying the justice system better have a home elsewhere for him if they release him on bail. He is not welcome in our community.” The leader of #NotInMyName SA in Atteridgeville, Phathuxolo Nofopo, said they were working with other activists to rally community support and expected a large turnout tomorrow. “We have circulated a community petition to oppose this bail application and it was also presented in court to show just how serious and concerned we are about this case. We even did door-to-door awareness campaigns in our community. “We will be hurt if we go to court and this man is released on bail to come back and live among us. This man proved that he is not worthy of bail and we urge the court to think carefully before delivering a verdict,” said Nofopo.
