A 47-year-old man will appear in the Ekangala Magistrate’s Court on Monday in connection with the murder of a Grade 2 pupil from Sikhulisile Primary School who was found dead in the bushes three weeks ago. Nhlanhla Sibanyoni  was found face down by a cow herder. The 9-year-old could not be identified immediately due to the extensive injuries to his face. His death sent shock waves across the country, social media platforms and the community located just outside Bronkhorstspruit. The community members said it appeared he had been beaten in the face with a blunt object. Police spokesperson Constable Connie Moganedi had previously said they were looking for the child’s step-grandfather for questioning. “We arrested the suspect during the day yesterday and he will appear in the Ekangala Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He was arrested in KwaMhlanga,” she told the Pretoria News. Thobile Sibanyoni, the boy’s mother said the family were told the suspect, who has lived with them since 2014, had on the morning of the tragedy left a note threatening that he would murder the boy, who was buried last week. In the note, which has since been taken by police, it was stated: “Nhlanhla and I are dead and I have enough pills to kill the both of us".
