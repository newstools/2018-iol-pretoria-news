Hundreds of people, including pupils and the SAPS participated in the march holding placards with messages such as “No to drugs”. The activity was collectively arranged by the Sinoville Crisis Centre, Sinoville SAPS and the Sinoville CPF. All said they were aware of the severity of the problem and wanted to tackle it before it got worse. The march started at the corner of Dr Swanepoel Road and Sefako Makgatho Drive and ended at the Kolonnade Shopping Centre. It was greeted with onlookers taking photos and videos for social media. Recording artist, actor, life coach and international radio host Emanuel Pietersen said drug abuse and dealers were a problem in the area. “We were sick and tired of dealing with drugs in our community so we told ourselves that we are going to fight drugs head-on by leading by example. We are going to speak out because new drugs and methods come out every single day, which creates high risks of complications and disease for substance users. This thing is severe in schools and we will not look away.” He said it was heart-warming to see so many parents and police come together to stand together against something that killed their community. “The key message behind the march was to say we are sick and tired of drugs and we will report on the issue without fear.” He said sometimes people got tired when the police spoke about drugs in the community, but when it came from the people they relate to they tend to listen and be involved. He said it was important for him as being in the public eye meant using the platform to create awareness about community issues. To end off the march, pupils and community members signed a pledge to not use drugs.
