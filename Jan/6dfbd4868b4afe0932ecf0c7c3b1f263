Carrying the rank of principal provincial inspector, Masemola was nabbed during a joint sting operation following complaints via the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s (RTMC) hotline, alleging he was removing motor vehicle licence discs and taking driving licences from motorists. “Complaints were that he told motorists they had committed traffic offences,” spokesperson Simon Zwane said. “Victims would then allegedly be instructed to deliver money ranging from R1500 upwards to the officer at the regional offices of the provincial traffic department in exchange for their documents” he said.  A joint sting operation was conducted. “A number of driving licences and motor vehicle discs were found during a search at his offices.” His next court appearance will be in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on January 31, facing additional charges once statements from owners of the seized documents are made. Zwane said  traffic officers were not  allowed to take motorists' driving licences from them unless the vehicle was unroadworthy.
