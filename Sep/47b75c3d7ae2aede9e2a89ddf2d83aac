Staff of the human rights and Palestine solidarity organisation, BDS South Africa, will participate in a lawful picket at the zoo (Jan Smuts entrance) today. Animal conservationists, experts, residents of Johannesburg and other citizens are calling for her release. Lammie has languished alone since the death of her partner, Kinkel, and elephant experts believe she should be moved to a sanctuary where she can roam more freely for her well-being. Lammie is a drawcard at the zoo, but the question of her future has led to heated debate in conservation circles. In an article for Conservation Action Trust, Melissa Reitz writes that the loss of her partner is not the first traumatic event for captive-born Lammie, who has been at the zoo for the past 39 years. Lammie’s parents, Jumbo and Dolly, died at the zoo within a year of each other. Her brother died soon after being sold to a French zoo. The Joburg Zoo has confirmed that it plans to acquire another elephant cow to keep Lammie company, but animal welfare and elephant experts say the lone elephant should be released into a wild reserve and rather bond with a herd. The EMS Foundation has offered to find a suitable sanctuary and to cover costs. South Africa’s Elephant Norms and Standards prohibits the capture of elephants in the wild for permanent captivity.
