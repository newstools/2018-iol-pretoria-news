He said afterwards that he wasn't sure he would do it again but, with his undying spirit and in an effort to fight the so-called bluetooth nyaope, he is back and will be at the forefront of the long walk this weekend. “I’m exhausted and let’s not forget about the pain as well. I remember there were times when I wanted to cry; the experience was gruesome. Will I be doing it again next year? I’m not too sure about that,” he said after the walk last year. The two-day 106km from Joburg to Soshanguve walk is aimed at decreasing the spread of HIV, and the NPO wants to raise funds for the Fetsa Tlala Agricultural community project. As part of the project, recovering nyaope users are employed on farms in Tshwane. Participants in the walk, hosted by the Clean Up Squad and Thandanani Drop off Centre, will leave Sandton, Joburg, at 6am on Friday. They are expected to reach Mamelodi that afternoon. They will then walk on to Soshanguve on Saturday. The Clean Up Squad has roped-in Mamelodi’s Fetsa Tlala agricultural community project to highlight the snowballing numbers of HIV through the blood-sharing practice in Tshwane. At least 100 walkers will visit bluetooth nyaope drug hotspots in Marabastad, Mamelodi and Soshanguve and users will be given information on rehabilitation centres, clothes and food. The walk will start at Sandton’s Grayston off-ramp. Walkers are expected to gather at 4am.
