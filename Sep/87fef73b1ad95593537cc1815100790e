A letter from the City of Tshwane or not - employees stationed at the Correctional Services' Poyntons Building head office in Pretoria central refuse to go back into the building until it is safe. Members of the correctional services clad in their brown uniforms could be seen sitting outside the entrance of the Poynton’s building on Church Street earlier today. Employees affiliated to trade union Popcru, refused to resume their duties at the building following executive mayor Solly Msimanga’s closure of the building on September 12. Msimanga shut down the building in what he termed as "serious breaches" of fire and emergency evacuation regulations. His surprise visit to the departmental building in the city centre, followed the events that saw three firefighters die after struggling to douse an inferno at a government building in Johannesburg the week before.

Ntsako Khosa, chairperson of Popcru, said the employees refused to return to work as the building was still non-compliant in terms of safety standards. Khosa said even though they had received a letter from the City stating that the building was now compliant, the same letter also stipulated that the building was not fully compliant with all safety regulations. “The letter states that the water supply in the event of fire was correct but upon arrival at the building the water booster indicated the levels were too low. “Should the building catch fire emergency services won't be able to get water nearby and to make matters worse evacuation points are still not working so people would be trapped.”
