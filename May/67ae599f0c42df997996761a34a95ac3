"But because we are divided, we are failing to fight these problems and now drug dealers are gaining power because of the division in our communities and in the meantime our children are dying," he said. Mthombeni said drug users were not a problem but the problem was rather those selling drugs to children in the community. "If we can come together and fight drugs, I promise you that in three months we can conquer this drug problem we have in our communities," said Stella Sebati, founder and chairperson of Moremogolo Maphuthaditshaba. She told those who had gathered that they were not at the hall to just grace the day, but rather, they wanted to leave a message with the community to say no to drugs and alcohol abuse. virgilatte.gwangwa@inl.co.za
