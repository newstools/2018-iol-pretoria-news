Malema wasted no time in voicing his opinion while the AfriForum media briefing was still in progress in Centurion yesterday. He tweeted: “Bring it on bloody racists; you don’t scare me at all. I’m born ready. No white man will decide my destiny; the poor masses of our people will,” Malema posted. The EFF labelled AfriForum’s decision to prosecute Malema as a plot to destruct the party on its quest to push for land expropriation without compensation. “The EFF is at the forefront of the struggle for land expropriation without compensation and AfriForum is one of its right wing opponents.” Head of the AfriForum prosecution unit, advocate Gerrie Nel, however, said prosecuting Malema was simply “equality before the law”. He said he would not reply to Malema’s tweet because he was not one to comment on what people he was prosecuting said about him or his intention. He simply followed the law and did his job in court. The charges against Malema related to alleged corrupt activities of On-Point Engineering, a company that  was rendering services to the Limpopo Department of Roads and Transport. Malema’s family trust had a vested interest in the company. AfriForum said the Hawks investigated the matter and found proof of corruption. It was about time people of political influence were also held responsible. Someone like Malema, who claims to represent the poor and plunders state coffers to enrich himself at the cost of poor people, must be exposed."
