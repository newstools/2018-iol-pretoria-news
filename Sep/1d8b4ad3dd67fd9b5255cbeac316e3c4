They have an option to either join or create their own clean-up groups for the global social action programme aimed at combating the solid waste problem, including marine debris. Corporate social investment spokesperson for the Shoprite Group Lunga Schoeman said: “Anyone can join; they can visit www.actforchange.africa to either join of host. Everyone is encouraged to participate and clean schools, churches, clinics or streets.” The aim, Schoeman said, was to hold the biggest clean-up in history. “This global drive presents the perfect opportunity for people to get behind our initiative to act for change by cleaning their neighbourhoods and public spaces. “Our aim is to start a movement through our involvement in regular clean-up events, and in this way initiate people into the culture of keeping our environment clean,” he told the Pretoria News. Schoeman said they staged successful clean-up events in July. He said 12 African countries came on board. “A total of 12 000 people took part and we were able to collect 26 000 bags of waste from communities, and 25 events were held in Pretoria, where 251 people volunteered. “There 543 bags, which on average amounts to over half a ton of waste, were collected at these clean-ups. There is value in waste, with recycling offering earning opportunities that can be exploited,” he said. Cans fetch the highest price, selling on average at R11/kg, with plastic, depending on the density, going for about R4/kg.
