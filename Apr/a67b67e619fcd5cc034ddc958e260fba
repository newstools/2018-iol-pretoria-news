The 22-year-old DJ was with friends at Short Left pub in Soshanguve last Monday night for the regular “Mogodu Monday”. He claimed a man he didn’t know bumped into him and his group and provoked them into a fight. Security personnel at the pub witnessed the altercation, intervened and dragged the man outside. “The man lingered outside, after a while he left the area. I thought nothing more of it than that it was a drunken brawl,” he told the Pretoria News from his home. “I’m not the type to get into fights or arguments. I just moved back home from Joburg; so all I wanted to do was continue working to help my mother out.” After his set, Ngwenya said he and his friend decided to head home, only to be stopped by an unknown car on a quiet road. Two men emerged from the car parked in the middle of the road and started shooting at his car, he claimed. In his version, the hail of bullets shattered his back windscreen and punctured holes in his car, but he and his passenger managed to escape unscathed. Ngwenya said: “I think even they were shocked because they shot straight at the front passenger window, and the bullet didn’t even go through but simply cracked the window. “I don’t think it was a hijacking because my car is recognisable around the area. What would be the point of shooting at us then?” After the incident, Ngwenya and his friends visited the scene and found 15 shell casings on the ground, he said. Despite the incident he said he was determined not to live his life fearing he would be killed. “I believe God saved me because it wasn’t my time to die. Until my time comes, I refuse to hide and live in fear.” Police spokesperson Constable Zanele Mtsweni said the shooting had been reported to them and was being investigated. Mtsweni said the details of the shooting were yet to be established, and they were investigating a case of malicious damage to property.
