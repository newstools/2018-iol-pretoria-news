The Standard Bank of British South Africa, Limited - later known as the Standard Bank of SA  - celebrates 155 years in the country - with its first branch having opened in 1863 in Port Elizabeth. It became the first bank on the diamond fields - with a bank in Klipdrift (Barkly West) opening in 1870, and another opening in a tent in Ferreira’s Camp in what was to become Joburg during the gold rush. In 1877, after the Transvaal was annexed by Britain, the bank opened four branches, including in Pretoria, which also served as head office until 1959 when this was moved to Joburg. The imposing (building) which stands on the southern side of Church Square replaced the original bank buildings in the early 1930s.  Designed by Stucke and Harrison, it reflects the classical Ionic order, with colonnaded loggias on the north side and a pilaster treatment on the west façade, according to artefacts.co.za. The entrance, which forms the base to the central feature in the Church Square façade, is fitted with fine heavy bronze doors while the upper part consists of a large semi-circular-headed window three storeys in height, with the main cornice arched over it to emphasise the entrance. Inside, the entrance has the body of the walls panelled in green marble while the banking hall is panelled in dark mahogany. The floor of green mosaic is relieved by a pattern border in black mosaic and one of the striking features is the circular mahogany counter standing on a black marble base.
