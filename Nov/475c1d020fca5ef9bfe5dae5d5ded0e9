Pretoria - Rustenburg residents who set up camp at the Unions Buildings have no plans to return to their North West homes until President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses them. These Ramokokastad villagers want the country’s highest office of public service to intervene and end what they call the “misuse” of community funds meant for the Baphalane Tribe. They want Ramaphosa to remove Chief Joy Ramokoka and his administration and then appoint a “neutral” administration and an interim administration to lead the tribe. At least 300 community members travelled to Pretoria in buses on October 24. They have since sent most of the elderly, employed and young people back home. Community leader Charles Makinta said: “We are now left with at least 150 community members who are camping here until the presidency speaks to us. "We delivered a memorandum early this year and now we want assurances. We are not leaving here until they assure us a new administrator will be appointed. “Our community is very poor and people are not working. The mines give our community development trust millions but we don’t see that money benefiting the people. It benefits the royal, their friends and those with political connections.” The people said they want government go give a fair process to the three royal families in their community to determine the rightful chief. They said their community was rocked by numerous protests since the beginning of this year due to various community grievances . The people said they want government to suspend the Batlase Development Trust until their concerns are addressed so that there could be peace in their community.
