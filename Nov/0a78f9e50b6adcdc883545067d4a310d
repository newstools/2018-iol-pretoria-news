Executive mayor Solly Msimanga said his DA-led administration was of the view that the economic situation at the market could be improved. In May 2016, the ANC-dominated council passed a report which sought to transfer the market to a private entity to manage it on behalf of the City. The report, which was compiled by the University of Pretoria, also said processes to lease the market were still at a consultative stage. The decision to lease the market had been taken after an assessment of its performance showed it was not doing well. The move was based on the findings of an investigation by the National Agricultural Marketing Council, which found that the performance of national markets generally since 1996 showed very little volume growth. But Msimanga said: “I don’t think we need to do that. When we came in we hired an expert to come up with a (business) plan for the market.” He said the intention had been to fund such a plan, which had since been concluded. “We are now funding the plan through phases. The first phase was to make sure we get the physical building in order,” he said. Msimanga added that R60million had been injected into the maintenance of the facility. He said the municipality had fixed the fridges and some generators. “The process now is to get permanent security on site,” he said. He said another aspect would be to address business issues at the market. “The business issues will include ways to better market the place, and also to attract back those who have left over the years,” he said. The City had already had a meeting with Potato SA and the agencies operating at the market. “We have had talks about what needs to happen to ensure that the market continues to grow in the trajectory that we want it to grow,” Msimanga said. On Friday, he visited the market to inspect the progress. He said afterwards: “I have seen a lot of improvement. The place has been fixed, and it has been better cleaned.”
