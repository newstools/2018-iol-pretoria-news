“This request was processed in accordance with the Departmental Policy on Amenities of Inmates, where compassionate leave is granted for the attendance of funerals and/or a serious sick­ness where it is expected that the person is dying. “This concession is only granted when it concerns a direct family member - father, mother, child, spouse, bro­ther, sister, grandfather and grandmother,” said Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. “Inmates can apply for compassionate leave and must be considered by the head of centre taking into consideration the criteria which list a number of variables. These include, but are not limited to, an inmate classified as low risk, demonstrating good behaviour and being actively involved in rehabilitation programmes.” Nxumalo said Pistorius was escorted to the memorial service and has since returned to the correctional centre. The world-famous athlete is incarcerated in Atteridgeville. He was reportedly struggling after news that his 101-year-old grandfather, Hendrik Pistorius, died on October 19. Pistorius is serving a 13-year sentence at the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre for the 2013 Valentine’s Day murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. He is likely to become eligible for parole around 2023. - African News Agency (ANA)
