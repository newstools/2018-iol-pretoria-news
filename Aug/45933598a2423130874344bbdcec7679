Tuks captain Libbie Janse van Rensburg organised the tournament in an attempt to promote women’s sevens rugby. “It is essential to continually create awareness for women’s sevens rugby as it is a new Olympic sport,” said Janse van Rensburg. “One of the ways to do so is to organise tournaments to give teams the opportunity to play. You can’t expect players just to train but never put into practice what they have learned. “I was pleasantly surprised when Northwest Pukke accepted our invitation as I did not realise that they even had a women’s team. “The more teams there are in South Africa, the better it will be for our sport, especially when it comes to international tournaments as there will be a bigger pool of players from which selections can be made. Hopefully, with our next tournament, we will have another new team playing.” The Tuks Women's Rugby seven’s team had their work cut out to beat Pirates 19-12 during Saturday’s final. In the play-off for the third place, Mamelodi managed to beat Northwest Pukke 31-5. This coming weekend, the Tuks Women’s Rugby seven’s team will be competing in the Xando Tshwane Tournament at Harlequins. - African News Agency (ANA)
