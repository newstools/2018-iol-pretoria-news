The Pretoria News has it on good authority that Murphy would appear at the Labour Court to challenge Mosola’s accusation in his founding affidavit in which he alleged that the COO played a role in the procurement of the controversial R12billion tender to oversee infrastructure rollout. At least three sources confirmed that Murphy’s lawyers filed papers in the Labour Court on Tuesday to allow him to be part of today’s proceedings. “They have filed what is legally called ‘intervention’; in simple terms, it means joining proceedings as a friend of the court,” a source close to the proceedings said. Murphy was tasked by council at its special sitting on September 10 to appoint an independent and external company to investigate the tender. Mosola approached the court towards the end of last month to interdict Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga, speaker Katlego Mathebe and the council from tabling the interim report of the investigation, conducted by Bowmans attorneys. The report was to be tabled at the October ordinary sitting of council. The court granted Mosola a temporary relief and postponed the matter to today. In terms of the interim report, the procurement of GladAfrica by the City of Tshwane was irregular. - Kennedy Mudzuli
