Pretoria - The ANC in Tshwane announced that it was calling for a secret ballot in an urgent motion of no confidence against mayor Solly Msimanga for alleged knowledge of irregularities in the awarding of a multibillion-rand tender to GladAfrica. The ANC this morning held a brief conference at Tshwane House to announce that Msimanga was using under-investigation city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola as a scapegoat. Chairperson Dr Kgosi Maepa said Msimanga worked together with Mosola but to avoid blame he was either saying “I don’t know” or  “I am not sure” to questions. Maepa pleaded that political parties represented in council should work together to oust Msimanga by voting with their conscience. He said a secret ballot would prove that there were DA councillors who already wanted the mayor to be recalled from his position. “It is clear from the report presented by the executive mayor during a special council sitting on August 22 that he, in fact, knew about the alleged irregularities associated with the multi-billion rand tender in the office of the City Manager. “The pertinent issue is that from November 2017 to July 2018, the mayor knew about the corrupt scandal and even after supply chain reports were presented to him during the period, he did not inform the council about the matter,” said Maepa. The ANC said it was not hungry for power but it wanted to make people aware that Msimanga neglected an important aspect of due skill and care in providing oversight to the executive as expected by the council. The ANC showed journalists a thick file containing copies signed by Mosola and Msimanga which indicated that Msimanga was always aware of the irregularities. A majority of the documents were emails exchanged between the two and other senior officials. The ANC did not allow media to take photos of the documents but said they would be released to the media and public in due time. Pretoria News
