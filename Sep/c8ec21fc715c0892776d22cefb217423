Father and son Big Boy and Leshole Mabitsela are finally in Durban and oh boy are they having the time of their lives. You see over the years, Skeem Saam viewers have really taken the “Mabitselas” storyline to heart. The two have it hard, as they only survive on an income the father, Big Boy Mabitsela (real name Charles Maja) makes as a mechanic.  The last time something good happened for the family was when Leshole (real name Thabo Mkhabela) passed his matric early this year. Now the writer is getting countless applause from social media users for finally giving the characters something to be happy about. There were hiccups that nearly prevented the trip from happening, but they finally got it all sorted and headed to Durban for their vacation. Now since their arrival, they’ve been taking pictures of everything; the beach and activities. The pictures have been shared rapidly by fans on social media, saying they are happy for them.
