From as early 8.30am, the Appetite Fest attracted thousands of foodies who filed through the indoor and outdoor stalls looking through the unusual and numerous offers on sale. From craft alcohol beverages to forever straws, potjie spices, burgers, make-up stalls, popcorn ice cream and live music, the arena was a hive of activity. Virtually every delicacy one could imagine was there for the grabbing, if you were prepared to queue a bit. There was also the cooking theatre for children, and popular chicken strips, watermelon and Parmesan cheese stalls, which were all a hit. Aspiring chefs could be seen milling excitedly around the arena clad in their white chef jackets. Those present also got to meet genial MasterChef Australia stars Matt Preston, Gary Mehigan and George Calombaris. Shirley Roberts, who attended J’Something’s masterclass, said there was so much to do she didn’t know how she would get to it all. “It’s a very wonderful experience and I think next year they need to find an even bigger venue to host this festival. Now I can’t wait to get home and bake cookies for my grandchildren with the ideas I got from the masterclass session!” she said.
