RUDZANI MATSHILI DESPITE the two week strike being called off by Unisa workers the queues outside the Sunnyside campus remain very long. The strike, which disrupted the registration and application processes, was called off on Friday following the protracted salary negotiation process,  which dated back to August 2017. The workers, under the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) staged protests at both the main and Sunnyside campuses to demand a salary increase of 12% among other things. And as the closing date for registrations for prospective and returning students looms, thousands of students have been queuing to secure space for enrollment. Others, who have registered online also went to the campuses to check their status and they too had to stand in the long queues.

And this morning 28-year-old Thulani Sikhaolelo from Atteridgeville said he had arrived at around 10am to register for a social work course but decided to not go ahead because of the long queue. “I asked to be excused at work today just so I could come register, but this queue is too long and I'm not willing to stand for that long,” he told Pretoria News. He would register for the second semester, Sekhaolelo said. However, Tebogo Modondo, 19, of Tembisa who had already registered online said he was going to wait there until he got the assistance he needed. “I'm definitely not happy at all with the long queue but this is my future we are talking about, so I will be here no matter how long it takes me.” “I have already registered but I'm just here to check my status and just to be sure that my registration went through,” he said.
