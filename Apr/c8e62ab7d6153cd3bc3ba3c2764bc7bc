Attendance is free, and the show saw more than 1 000 people filling up Opera Theatre. The show honours Madikizela-Mandela’s memory through song, dance, poetry and storytelling. Some of the artrists expected to perform are Sibongile Khumalo, Rebecca Malope, Oliver Mtukudzi, Zahara and many more.

With the theatre having vowed to bring magic and a unique moving tribute to the crowd prior to the show; they certainly delivered. Mama Winnie was an avid supporter of arts who always enjoyed engaging with young artists, according to the theatre reiterating that she deserved all the honours she got. “She was a loyal supporter of the State Theatre, especially its artistic work that featured South African talent and told stories of the pre and post-apartheid South Africa. Her last visit to the theatre was in August 2017 when she came to watch Marikana-the musical by the multi award winning playwright and artistic director Aubrey Sekhabi,” CEO Sibongiseni Mkhize said.
