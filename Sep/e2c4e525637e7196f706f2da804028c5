The show programme includes aerial displays by the Silver Falcons, Gripens and Hawk fighter aircraft which will start at 8am at the weekend, but gates will open at 6am for people to go in. The main roads to be affected are Solomon Mahlangu, which is the off-ramp on the R21/Airport Road, and Trichardt Road leading to the main entrance and Veldpou Street next to the Air Force Base. Only park-and-ride buses will be allowed on Trichardt and Veldpou. There will also be road closures at Dastek and on Van Ryneveld Avenue. Visitors are advised to access the show from the Botha Avenue and Rigel Avenue off-ramps on the N1 or Nellmapius Drive on the R21. Traffic and emergency officials will be on duty to manage traffic flows and all closures and detours will be clearly marked.  AAD ATTENDEES:  AS thousands of aviation and defence enthusiasts started converging at the Air Force Base Waterkloof for AAD2018 from yesterday and into the weekend, organisers have put in place comprehensive plans to manage access and ease the traffic flows. Commercial Aviation Association Southern Africa chief executive Leon Dillman confirmed that regular bus shuttles would operate from the park-and-ride facilities close to the venue during the open days on Saturday and Sunday. Free parking will be available at various places in the vicinity. Visitors to Africa's largest international air show are advised to plan their journeys in advance and make use of the public transport arrangements which will be available. Residents living close to the Waterkloof Base are advised to familiarise themselves with the traffic arrangements and road closures and to consider alternative local routes on Saturday and Sunday. The highway will be cleared at about 3:30pm and all closures will end at 5:30pm to facilitate the resumption of normal traffic. The exhibition is deemed one of the best family outings in Gauteng this year and organisers hope to attract more than 100000 people over the five days of the expo.
