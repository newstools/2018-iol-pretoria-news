In the so-called “family photo” where the presidents line up in front of the media, he is not the only one with a red tie. President Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, likes red ties, but it is also a colour associated with revolution and the colour of China’s flag. Likewise, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin also wears red, while India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who does not wear ties, had a red handkerchief. Look too at the classic power combination of the crisp white shirts and custom suits of the four presidents wearing one; all dark with jackets cut to a certain length and the top of two buttons done up: the dress code of ambitious leaders. And then there’s the interesting aspect of the hands. In photos of world leaders one may see them standing hands at their sides, or perhaps giving a palm-forward wave. Donald Trump has been known to do a thumbs-up, and recently there’s been some hand-holding, even between men such as Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in during the Korean peninsular talks. But this photo shows something interesting in that the BRICS leaders are taking their friendship to a new level with their interlocking fingers demonstrating to the world a deeper connection and commitment. - Staff Reporter
