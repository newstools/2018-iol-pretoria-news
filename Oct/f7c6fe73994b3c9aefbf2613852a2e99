This was during the Unisa Language Festival roadshow held at a Laudium school. The learners were taught about the importance of multilingualism through dramatic art by HDI Youth Marketeers. Among them was 15-year-old Vasco Mendes, a Grade 9 learner, who said that prior to the presentation he did not know there were careers available by just studying linguistics. “I got inspiration from the drama they performed for us, and now I know that you can use language for anything. I never thought of taking language as a subject at university, but right now, anything is possible,” he said. The Portuguese-speaking pupil said he also got inspiration to speak his language proudly. “We are often scared to speak our own languages because of the fear that people might laugh at us, but today I was inspired that I should be proud to speak my language.” However, Vasco said he still wanted to study mechanical engineering. Principal Vilasen Padyachy said the roadshow was a great initiative and something learners needed as they often took languages for granted. “This is the first time pupils were told about the importance of languages, and you could tell that they were excited and were paying attention. I am looking forward to seeing more of this initiative at the school and I really appreciate that Unisa brought this programme here.” This is the 14th year since the launch of the language festival, hosted by the Unisa College of Human Sciences. The festival aims to leave a mark on and encourage young people to celebrate the various cultures and acknowledge that diversity can unite the country. Unisa College of Human Sciences deputy dean Dr Britta Zawada said: “Languages are part of our identity and it is part of our effort to transform and decolonise. Even at the university we are beginning to use African languages even more; all the study material in history this semester and next year has been translated into five African languages.”
