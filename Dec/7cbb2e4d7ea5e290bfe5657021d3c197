Women across the Gauteng province have spoken loud and clear with one call - "Fix SAPS Now." Thee DA Women's Network (Dawn) on Monday brought this very plea to the doorstep of the SAPS Maupa-Naga offices in Sunnyside Stefanie Ueckermann, Team One Gauteng spokesperson on women, said they had conducted a survey across the province speaking to women regarding what concerned them the most. With the message according to Ueckermann being the same from all, that the police had to be sensitive when dealing with gender-based violence cases. Ueckermann said the memorandum they were delivering to the police just as the country finished observing 16-days of Activism against gender-based violence against women and children was to call on the police to remain committed 365 days a year. This as crimes against women were a daily occurrence that was becoming a norm in numerous communities. The memorandum calls for an overhaul of the SAPS, for officers to be trained to deal with victims of rape and other sensitive crimes and to rapidly handle and investigate rape cases. It further calls for specialised units focusing on street safety, for the increase of outreach programmes focusing on child safety, compulsory sensitivity training for officers on an annual basis. And for sex workers to be treated fairly by members and not be victimised because of their profession. The organisation's memorandum was received by Major-General Ottilia Moutlane from the SAPS Protections and Security division who assured the organisation that they would receive a response within 14-days time as requested.
