The proposal to open wudhu and salaah facilities in the Kruger National Park was received in 2009. Kruger National Park managing executive Glenn Phillips said R850 000 was raised by the Muslim community to construct the facilities. Construction was under way at Lower Sabi, will continue to Satara Rest Camps, Afsaal and Tshokwane and will be built in other national parks too. “This project was facilitated by the SANParks Honorary Rangers Johannesburg South, who within a very short time raised the funds,” Phillips said. The facility includes a wash-up area known as a Wudhu facility for males and females. Muslim guests will have to provide their own prayer mats knows as Musallas. Yusuf Dockrat, chairperson of the SANParks Honorary Rangers Johannesburg South, urged Muslims: “This is a place of worship. Treat it as such.” African News Agency (ANA)
