This sentiment was shared at this year’s Gauteng Women in Sports Dialogue, held at the Sammy Marks chambers on Saturday. The event brought together female experts who excel in sports - be it on the field or in administration, and those aspiring to reach those levels. It was hosted by the Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation and was the third edition of the annual dialogue, also meant to honour the centenary of the late struggle stalwart Albertina Sisulu. For that reason, participants gathered at the Women Living Heritage Monument in the CBD before heading to the Sammy Marks chambers. One of the organisers, Philasande Muvevi, who is a director of competitive sports at the department, said the seminar was themed “Uplift her Performance to Greatness” to provide a platform to uplift women and girls in sport. She said the dialogue provided a platform to link women in sports with other women who were captains of industry, transcending barriers affecting women and girls excelling in sports and applying collective knowledge and insight for their advancement in participation. “As government, we provided transport to mobilise women participating in different sporting codes from around Gauteng so they could participate in the dialogue. For us, if we could change one girl’s life or get a champion out of this, not only on the field but administratively, then we would have done our job.” The University of Pretoria's deputy director at the Department of Sports Lydia Monyepao said the event helped them learn about the challenges faced by women and girls in townships. “As a university we have a responsibility to empower our girls in sports.”
