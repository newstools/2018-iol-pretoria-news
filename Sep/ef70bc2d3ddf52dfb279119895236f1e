Yet another ANC councilor was shot dead in Winterveld by unknown suspects on Wednesday night. The incident happened at least four months after a Soshanguve councillor Simphiwe Montlha was killed outside his home. Police have confirmed the untimely passing of ward 19 councilor Esther Matumane, saying it happened at 7:15pm. Tshwane ANC chairperson Kgosi Maepa said: "We were told by the family that councillor Esther received a call to go out of the house before she was shot." Maepa said Matumane was driving with a gentleman in a car and also with her three children. On her way she was stopped by one of the locals, who asked her about a faulty meter. Maepa said she was ambushed by unknown suspects in two cars - a Renault and a VW Polo. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
