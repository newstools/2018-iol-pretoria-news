SAKHILE NDLAZI Trade union Solidarity laid criminal charges with the police in Garsfontein, the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority against former CEO Brain Molefe and former Eksom board chair Ben Ngubane. According to Solidarity Chief Executive Dirk Herman, the facts indicate that Molefe and Ngubane had teamed up to put together an unlawful transaction in terms of which pension money of R30million had been awarded to Molefe. Solidarity is also asking that criminal charges be laid against Molefe and Ngubane for, among others, fraud as Molefe has been enriched as a result of an unlawful act to the detriment of Eksom. The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria last month ruled that Molefeâ€™s reinstatement as Eskom boss was invalid and that he was never entitled to his pension benefits, therefore he must pay back the money. He is appealing that ruling. According to Herman, a criminal case can be brought against Molefe and Ngubane. Solidarity is requesting the Hawks to investigate the matter and ask that the allegations be tried in court.
