And at the same time South Africa’s golden girl sent a powerful riposte to Australia, who were once one of the leaders of the gender war against her. Australia’s Sydney Daily Telegraph, for instance, made spurious claims that Semenya was a hermaphrodite which played a significant part in the debacle that unfairly shone the spotlight on a teenage girl. But cheers rang out at the Carrara Stadium yesterday when Semenya was introduced, while she received a standing ovation as she crossed the line, signifying how much can change in almost 10 years. Semenya ran the perfect tactical race as she sat back within striking distance before unleashing a devastating surge over the final 200m. Semenya was pure determination over the final stretch, as she inched closer to the record one powerful step at a time, and she crossed the line in a time of 4:00.71, just over a second faster than Budd’s record. Budd set the record of 4:01.81 in Port Elizabeth in March 1984, before she departed for the UK. Semenya said she had an inkling the record would tumble after the first two laps, but was certain it would belong to her at the bell. “I knew at the 800m because the time was 2:08, I knew I must just wait, wait and move at the last 250m because I don’t want to mess up my fellow Africans’ race,” Semenya said. “I actually knew from the last lap that the record was gone and I just needed to maintain the pace.” See Sport
