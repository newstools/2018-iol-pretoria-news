james.mahlokwane@inl.co.za Unisa vice-chancellor professor Mandla Makhanya told media that it encouraged its staff to exhaust all internal avenues before approaching the media, following a series of allegations and counter-allegations of racism and sexual harassment. Makhanya said the institution took these allegations very seriously and condemned all the alleged acts and was acting on all those reported allegations despite complaints that Unisa was sluggish and reluctant to intervene. He said the university has already suspended a few staff members pending investigations into allegations made against them. Unisa was also intervening in two "formally reported" sexual harassment cases in one organisation operating within its premises. The organisation was independent from Unisa but since the accused perpetrators were Unisa staff, they have since been suspended. The one person accused of sexual harassment in the Early Childhood Development organisation was put on suspension alsongside another individual who allegedly refused to act on the offence when it was reported. Makhanya also announced that Unisa was now in the process or reviewing its harassment policy in order to adequately address harassment, in particular sexual harassment. Unisa subsequently hired an harrassment officer to lead the processes of thouroughly investigating all harassment allegations without fear or favour. The vice-chancellor also took time to highlight that Unisa also noted challenges that were experienced by students, such as ITC systems becoming slow during peak times when most students are due. Makhanya said Unisa also experienced challenges regard the delivery of study material and the supply of assignment feedback.
