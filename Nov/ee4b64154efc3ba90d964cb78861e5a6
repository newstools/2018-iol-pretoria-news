The awards are Africa’s First Ethnic Hair platform, giving recognition to the multibillion-rand industry, and will be held in December. Afri-Berry was nominated for the Hair and Beauty Entrepreneur of the Year and Natural Hair Product Range of the Year categories. An optimistic Moeng said she was confident they would be bringing the awards home. “By virtue of the nomination, I already feel like a winner whether we win or or not. “The awards are close to our hearts, because they are proudly African. This is special because as an emerging company its often very difficult to play with the big guys,” she said. Bagging the awards would give the company more recognition, she said. “It would be a blessing, and add to other awards we have, to endorse what we do and what we stand for.” The 37-year-old added: “We are blessed as a company to be in Mzansi because we understand the needs of Africans better. We are closer to the people and get more involved in community based events and initiatives. “We were acknowledged for employing unemployed graduates.” Moeng also reflected on how the brand came about. In 2008, she and three others were in an accident, which left her with serious facial injuries. “It left me with over 150 stitches on my face. I looked for affordable solutions to reduce my scars. It was cold-pressed argan oil that yielded results, so following my retrenchment from work, my husband Fabian and I decided to do research on skin and hair products. This led to the launch of our company in 2011.” She asked city residents to support her and vote.
