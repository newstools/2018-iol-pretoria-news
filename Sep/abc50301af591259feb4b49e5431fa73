Scores of high school pupils have descended on the Waterkloof Air Force Base to learn about careers available in the defence industry. They travelled from various schools in Gauteng to take part in this year's Africa Aerospace Defence exhibition (AAD2018), launched yesterday by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The pupils are proud to be viewing defence equipment and aircraft alongside national and international delegates deployed here for business purposes. The pupils are also treated to air show rehearsals in preparation for Saturday and Sunday when the exhibition will be opened to the public. Defence generals and other seniors officers are giving lessons on employment opportunities the pupils could apply for after graduating high school in the next couple of years. They are taught about the role and importance of the Africa Aerospace Defence Youth Development Programme that sought to expose youth to careers in aviation.
