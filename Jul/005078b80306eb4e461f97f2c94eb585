The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 10-year-old child, is also being charged with sexual grooming, exposure of a child to pornography and sexual assault. He was appearing for a bail hearing yesterday. The man is alleged to have moved to Verulam - about 30km inland of Durban - from Joburg six months ago with the child. The girl’s biological mother and father are both dead. The court heard that the case was brought to the police’s attention when the girl was beaten and chased out of the room she was sharing with her stepfather. She approached a neighbour and told of the alleged abuse she had suffered. “Vibrators were confiscated, DVDs, dildos from the accused,” investigating officer Nevarge Lutchminarain told the court. The suspect allegedly used the sex toys on the young girl. Lutchminarain further told magistrate Irfaan Khalil he believed the accused was a flight risk and should be denied bail because he had no fixed address or identity documents. He also believed that incarceration would ensure the safety of the accused, who had been threatened with violence by community members. The man had also threatened his stepdaughter if she revealed what he had done to her, said Lutchminarain, and had also threatened the child’s family. The girl is in a place of safety. - African News Agency (ANA)
