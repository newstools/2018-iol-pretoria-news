Featuring prominently among the awardees was Mavuso Msimang, who received a gold medal for his extraordinary contribution to the transformation of the environmental and conservation sector over the past 30 years. “I'm really humbled by this award. It is an enriching experience to work with people in the conservation environmental sector. I find them extremely knowledgeable and very modest,” said the 76-year-old chairperson of Corruption Watch. “For me, it's a double honour that I should have been given the Living Planet Award recently,” he added. Wessa Awards, presented since 1974, enable society to recognise and honour those who made a significant contribution to environmental conservation or the environmental education sector in SA over the past year in an exceptional, sustained manner. The Wessa Youth Award was given to Grade 10 pupil Dikgang Atlegang of Lebone II College of the Royal Bafokeng in Rustenburg in recognition of his actions as a key initiator of the Paper4Bread campaign in North West. “Wessa acknowledges him as an enthusiastic and thoughtful young leader who has had a national impact on waste management." The Wessa Individual Award went to Paul Duncan, for his “many years of hard work and significant financial support and provision of resources for the combating of rhino poaching in the Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park”. The Wessa Group Award went to the Friends of Blaauwberg Conservation Area, and the Wessa Award for Corporates was given to the eThekwini Municipality and Nampak company.
