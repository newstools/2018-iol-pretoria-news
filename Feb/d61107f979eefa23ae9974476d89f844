“This is the start of the cabinet lekgotla, which will end on Friday, led by the President Jacob Zuma, together with the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. “This is our first engagement (for 2018) as cabinet, looking at preparations for the year, mainly preparing first for the Sona and preparing for our budget speech,” Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said. “We will go into various areas of work. "The main focus should be around the economy. We will be looking at various issues around the economy, growing the economy, creating jobs as part of our work as government and cabinet.” The high-level meeting, chaired by Zuma, is attended by cabinet ministers, their deputies and director-generals of various government departments. “On Friday, as normal, as you know, we will be joined by the premiers (of all nine South African provinces) and together with local government representatives as part of ensuring that (in) our work as government we enforce inter-government relations, making sure what we planned goes across between national government, provincial and local,” Kubayi-Ngubane said. “More details will be outlined of what was discussed in the Sona, because we can never say exactly, in detail, what we are doing for this year until it is outlined in Sona.” When journalists were ushered in momentarily for a photo opportunity where the meeting was being held, at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria, a jovial Zuma was sipping coffee, joking with reporters and Ramaphosa. - African News Agency (ANA)
