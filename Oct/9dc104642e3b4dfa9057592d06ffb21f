At Ribane Laka Secondary School in Mamelodi, which is synonymous with excellent matric results, the learners shared their expectations for the exams. They had, like their peers around the country, written English paper 1. They agreed that the paper was fair, which led them to believe and feel optimistic that the other papers would be equally fair. Koketso Ndlebe, 16, said the paper was fair and had not been too challenging. “I have been preparing and believe I am going to make it. “I was feeling uneasy at the beginning, about the exams, but this paper made me optimistic that maybe the other papers might be fair also,” she said. Her 17-year-old classmate, Jack Baloyi, said passing the exams was his top priority. “Today’s paper was just fine. I found myself challenged by question five. I was not really prepared. I am writing accounting tomorrow (today) and had put all my energy into that subject.” Sello Maphutha, 17, was more than thrilled that the exams had finally started. Patronelle Napo, 17, endorsed what her classmates said about the English paper being fair, but said she had shifted her focus to more serious subjects, such as physical science. “That paper was actually very fair and simple for me. It pumped me up for the physical science exam. I still want to revise for other subjects.” School principal Martha Ngoma said she was looking forward to excellent results from the Class of 2018.
