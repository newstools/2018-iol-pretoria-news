WOMEN heeded a call by the ANC to wear black with a doek, beret or head scarf on Friday in honour of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Women across the country have taken to different social media platforms to share pictures of themselves in black outfits In a statement from the African National Congress following the death of the struggle stalwart, the party called on women to wear black with a doek, beret or head scarf to honour her. The anti-apartheid activist and former wife of the late Nelson Mandela, died at the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Monday. She had been ill for some time and had been in and out of hospital since the beginning of the year. Affectionately known as 'Mother of the Nation', Madikizela-Mandela was lauded for holding the fort in the fight against apartheid when the apartheid regime arrested activists, including her former husband. She was hounded by state security police and subjected to imprisonment, torture, house arrest and endless banning orders. Her funeral will be held in Fourways, north of Johannesburg on April 14.
