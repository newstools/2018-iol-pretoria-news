Livid motorists are calling on the City of Tshwane to reinstate services at Centurion Licensing Centre after queuing for hours on end at Waltloo Licensing Centre. Most of of them were forced to go to Waltloo, after Centurion stopped offering some essential services. Motorists who drove public vehicles, complained that they couldn't obtain their Public Driving Permit (PDP) at Centurion and were referred to the already overcrowded Waltloo. Other complaints in Centurion included the scheduling of appointments for learners and drivers not being allowed. Others complained about the online registration. Motorists who were not technologically inclined or didn’t own computers or smartphones described the online registration as bias and prejudice. An Eersterust taxi driver, who didn’t want to be named, said the online registration was designed to suit the more privileged people. “They know very well that some taxi drivers are not technology savvy, yet they implement this on us,” he said. Thabiso Mogale, from Centurion, said he spent just about the whole day there trying to renew his driver’s licence. “I spent most of the time waiting for the eye test, and when it came to my turn to do the eye test, it was nearly home time so they were rushing and became rude and unhelpful,” he said. People started queuing before sunrise, and by 10am when the Pretoria News arrived there were almost 200 people still waiting to be assisted. The service officers can only help 10 people at a time, while the rest are left to queue outside, and the chilly weather also did not make things easier. The City of Tshwane was unavailable for comment.
