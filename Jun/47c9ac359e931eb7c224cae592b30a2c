THOUSANDS of the cityâ€™s senior secondary schools gathered at Unisa's ZK Mathews Great Hall for the learner-leadership talk at the Muckleneuk campus today. The 4th annual learner-leadership talk hosted by AgapeYouth Movement in partnership with the City of Tshwane, National Library of South Africa, Department of Basic Education and the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute saw pupils discuss their challenges and leadership knowledge among other things. Hyping up the crowd was the vibrant Karabo "Dynamite" Nyalunga from Nellmapius high school. She considers herself the next public protector. She told her peers that the vast difference between the youth of 1976 and that of 2018 is that the youth of 1976 had done so much but very little has been captured. "The youth of 2018, most of them are not doing much and everything is being captured," she said. During the panel discussions pupils highlighted thy reason for their ill-disciplined behavior was because they were often being looked down on. Grade 12 pupil from Steve Tshwete high school in Olivenhoutbosch, Harry Makobe said they needed to be exposed to better opportunities to what they were used to. "I'm from the township and all I'm exposed to is stealing and abuse, I don't know anything but that. "Right now in our schools we no longer have school outings like we used to before and we really need those so that we can see what is outside our normal lives. "Our schools need to move learners out of their normal environment, produce opportunities and expose them to better opportunities," he said
