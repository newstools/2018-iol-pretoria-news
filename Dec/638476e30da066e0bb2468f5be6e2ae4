The Brazilians, as Sundowns are known, welcome the Libyan side at Loftus Versfeld Stadium tomorrow. The match kicks off at 3pm. To fill up the stadium and thus create an unfriendly environment, Sundowns have decided to open the gates for fans wearing yellow, otherwise entry costs R20. The first-leg tie at Petro Sport Stadium in Cairo ended goalless despite Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane throwing everything forward in the dying minutes of the game. The Libyan side had chosen to play the game in Egypt due to the political unrest in their homeland. Despite not having Mosimane for much of the preparations, Sundown will still be hoping to end this year on a high by securing a place in the next round of the CAF Champions League. After the first-leg clash, the coach headed to Morocco. There he spent three days completing his CAF Pro Licence, leaving the team under the watchful eye of his second-in-command, Manqoba Mngqithi. Mosimane will be back in the dugout for the game, a must-win match for Sundowns, the former CAF Champions League victors. See sport
