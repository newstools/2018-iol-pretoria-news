The pupils spent the whole day learning more about protection biodiversity and how to contribute to create awareness to those who could not make it. They would take photos in the Fountains Valley as they toured the area and observed numerous animal and plants that needed to be protected. Professionals from varous nature and wildlife conservation organisations set up stalls to provide more information and knowledge to those who had questions, including Williams and MMC for Environmental and Agriculture Management, Mike Mkhari.
