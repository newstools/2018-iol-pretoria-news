Delegates, visitors and international journalists were treated to a show demonstrating defence action taken by soldiers during missions in times of combat. The demonstrations show soldiers arriving at battlefields in aircraft, parachutes and ground vehicles. Artillery guns were fired to demonstrate the noise soldiers have to withstanding in times of war in countries where they've been deployed to fight. Helicopters and high speed jets demonstrated their importance during war by quickly dropping off soldiers and swiftly flying away from the scene.
