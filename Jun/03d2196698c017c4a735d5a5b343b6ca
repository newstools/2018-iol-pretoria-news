These are the type of questions local high school quizzers may face when they meet in the first Pretoria News High School Quiz as part of the national high school quiz in partnership with the Independent Institute of Educationâ€™s Varsity College. Already a number of schools have confirmed their attendance - including Boys High which has entered two teams. Each team should consist of four pupils from Grades 9 to 11, with two teams allowed per school. Each team should have an adult mentor - such as a teacher or parent. The quiz is focused on current affairs, politics, sport, business and entertainment with questions taken from articles in the Pretoria News in the run up to the event. The winning Pretoria school team will get R20000 for their school, a bursary from IIE Varsity College to offer to a deserving pupil, and R2000 cash for each of the winning team members. This team will represent the capital city in the national quiz final in Sandton in September where the overall winning team gets a further R20000 for their school, with R5000 going to each team member.
