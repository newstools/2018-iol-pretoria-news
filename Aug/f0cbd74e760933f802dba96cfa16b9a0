"Don't wait until gender based attacks come through your family’s door before you start noticing that men need to take a responsive stance towards the scourge of violence against women." Living in a suburban area, Archbishop Mbulelo Dyasi, never thought the issue of abuse and Gender Based Violence GBV would ever happen to his family. But it was when he realised that little girls in his area as young as 13 years of age including his own were being taken by taxi drivers who had sex with them . A tearful Dyasi said he was heartbroken and never thought something like this would happen to his young girl and all he had was a piece of paper from the police stating that she had returned home. “We can't wait for funders any longer, or heads of states or ministers to act on this issue. We have to act now, we can’t say this thing must happen to you first before you act.” He added: “I didn’t know this was happening to my own child as I took it for granted that we were living in a safe place. To add insult to injury I was also failed by the police. So all men need to start being responsible for the change we need,” he added. Dyasi was speaking at the South African National Aids Council’s (SANAC) offices in Hatfield regarding the "Men Championing Change" Summit. The three day conference to be held in eBandla hotel and Conference centre in Ballito, KwaZulu-Natal will have men from all backgrounds and stakeholders gathered together to find a plan of action on how to start eradicating GBV in South African communities. With the aim to strengthen the capacity and co-ordination of the men’s civil society movement in the country under the theme:  “Institutionalising a Responsive Men’s Movement.”
