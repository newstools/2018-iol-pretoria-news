The trains had been off the tracks for two days due to cable theft. The users said these were just some of the headaches they had to deal with after the train services between Pretoria and Joburg were cancelled. Overhead centenary wires were cut and stolen at Irene. Yesterday, thousands of commuters were stuck at Pretoria Station and they complained that while the problem yesterday was criminal, they had to deal with the atrocious service daily. Among them were students from Tshwane South College in Centurion, who said most of the time they missed the first two lectures of their day. Tlhoriso Mogale was on the platform too yesterday, and he said he had missed a job internship opportunity while waiting for the train. Another commuter complained about safety. “You never know what time the train is coming,” said Dinha Mbolekwana. “The train system is so bad and the criminals know it. They get us when we wait for delayed trains.” Alternative transport, like buses, were organised by Metrorail, for loyal ticket holders, to travel between Olifantsfontein and Irene stations. Metrorail’s Goodman Matampi said: “Of great concern is the fact that the criminals are now targeting both lines to make sure the railway system is paralysed for peak period operation. We call for support from local government and law enforcement agencies to help us tighten all efforts in fighting this criminality,” he said. By yesterday afternoon, the services were restored.
