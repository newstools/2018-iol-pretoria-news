They chanted: “Be free Palestine, “Phansi Israel phansi” (down with Israel down) and “Down with Israel apartheid”. The protest, which affected traffic on the M18, was attended by members of several unions, student groups and human rights organisations including the PSA, BDS South Africa, NC4P and SA Jews for a Free Palestine. The SACP also attended. The activists had called on the Davis Cup to expel Israel over its human rights abuses in a similar way that apartheid South Africa was expelled from the Davis Cup during the 1980s over its policies. The protest was in support of the call for an end to Israel’s 50-year-long occupation of Palestinian territory. About 200 protesters blocked the road and threatened those attending the march. Police had to fire stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Earlier, they had booed and called motorists going into the country club to watch the match “sellouts”. Sport and Recreation Minister  Thulas Nxesi also supported the boycott of the match. Nxesi said his decision was also influenced by the personal humiliation he had experienced in 2012 when he was refused entry into Israel-Palestine. Back to the action South Africa will now face either Sweden, Ukraine or Portugal in a relegation play-off later this year, the winner remaining in Group 1, with the loser dropping to Group 2.
