He has called on the country to unite for the event “It’s Time” to be attended by churches, businesses and individuals. “Never in South Africa’s history has there been a greater need for people to unite, says Buchan. “Peace is fragile, the economy and business confidence are down adversely affecting job opportunities, the poor are becoming poorer, uncertainty and unrealistic demands are emerging, racism is more prevalent and South Africans are punch drunk as a result of fraud and corruption.” The free event is at the Rhino Park Airfield in Pretoria east. Free parking vouchers are available for access to parking areas on neighbouring farms from where participants will be able to walk to the event site and those wishing to can camp on site from Thursday night. The programme starts at 9am with the main meeting from noon. For more go to www.angusbuchan.co.za Staff Reporter
