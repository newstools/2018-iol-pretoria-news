This will come in the form of former Idols SA winner Karabo as well as Afrikan Roots, who will perform at the Genesis Lounge, State Theatre, on December 26. The two headline acts will be complemented by in-house resident DJs on the day, organised by Genesis Lounge manager Leroy Tau to celebrate the Day of Goodwill. The event will start at 4pm and continue until 10pm and promises to be a chilled and sophisticated night out. “Karabo has promised to deliver nothing but the best of what he is made of and known for Remember, it was at the State Theatre that his dreams came through when he was crowned Idols winner three years ago,” said Tau, also an author and speaker on relationship issues. “This is a homecoming for him to perform at the venue after all the highs and lows of his journey as a musician. This is sure going to be an interesting and great experience.” Since winning Idols SA in 2015, Karabo Mogane has transformed from a pop singer to a radio host, hosting the Sunday afternoon show (2pm to 6pm) on UJFM. His maturity is reflected in his 2018 release, Nginothando. Afrikan Roots will perform songs from their new album Dawn Of The 8th Day, which was released a few weeks ago and features the hit single FriTagwa. Staff Reporter
