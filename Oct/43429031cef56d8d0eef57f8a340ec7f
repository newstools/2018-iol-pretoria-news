AWARD winning Afro Pop sensation Vusi Nova might be heading back to studio for remix of his hit song Asiphelelanga, thanks to social media. Calls for the musician to go back to studio came after the passing of hip-hop star HHP yesterday. Tweeps want Nova to include HHP on his list of departed musicians listed on his song and perhaps the Maskandi singers as requested by genre fans . The song, featuring poet Jessica Mbangeni, pays tribute to fallen Mzansi heros. Maskandi fans recently expressed their unhappiness with the fact that the song mentioned none of late Maskandi artists. Speaking to the Pretoria News earlier today, the musician said he was well aware of the call and might just comply. The 32 year-old said: “We are thinking of actually going back to studio and maybe get a Hip Hop guy, a Maskandi guy, Gospel person, we are talking about it and it’s something that might just happen. “I think what I might do this time around is just get people who will do the song with me. We are not sure about when but its definitely gonna happen,” he said. He said: “The way I did it was to make sure that even though other people die after the song they are still included, myself included by the way, that’s how I crafted the song. “Even though I mentioned certain people but there’s a point where I do say at the end thanks to every single artist who’s had a contribution to this industry,” he said. Nova thanked his fans for the immense support.
