Known as the Future Park, this exhibition, which blurs the boundaries between art, science, technology and creativity, moves to Silverstar Casino from February 24 after a successful stint in Cape Town. Since its inception - the brainchild of a group of Tokyo University “ultra-technology” postgrads - it has attracted more than 5 million children across the world to play in a digital environment. In the sketch aquarium, children colour in a drawing of a sea creature of their choice. Once completed, the piece of paper is scanned and the image projected on to a giant virtual aquarium, where children can see their creation come to life and swim with the other creatures. Pictures drawn in Sketch Town can be turned into unique 3-D papercrafts. For younger children, there’s the Table where Little People live, which interacts with objects placed on it, while Connecting Block Town features cars and trains running in a townscape on digitally projected roads and tracks. Hopscotch for Geniuses features shapes projected on the floor which children can jump on to create a mixture of sound and colour. Future Park is open daily from 10am to 6pm. The cost is R130 (adults and children over 18); family package is R460. Pensioners and students R115. Tickets: Computicket or the door.
