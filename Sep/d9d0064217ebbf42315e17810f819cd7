THE Department of Labour director-general Thobile Lamati wants serious and harsh fines to deal with non-compliance in the workplace. He made the announcement today speaking on increased fatalities in the South Africa workplace, that have since caused numerous complaints. Lamati said the department was committed to push for a new labour bill with harsher punishment for companies with poor health and safety standards. The bill would bring bigger fines to twist the hands of affluent companies who became comfortable with paying small fines for the same offences. He said the bill is expected to enable the department’s inspectors to fine businesses on the spot as do traffic officers and also force businesses to share their incident reports. He said it was problematic that the current labour act had nothing to compel employers to conduct risk assessments and create employment safety management systems. “We are trying to make sure that the cost of non-compliance is severe to the fact that companies can fill it, and that alone can serve as a deterrent. (However), even with the new bill we will rely on the good will of the corporate sector and government to comply with the laws and make sure there is a maintenance budget to maintain government buildings,” Lamati added. The department said the most problematic companies were in construction, iron and steel and the wholesale and retail sectors. Masutha extended his condolences to the families of firefighters who lost their lives putting out a fire a government building in Johannesburg last week.
