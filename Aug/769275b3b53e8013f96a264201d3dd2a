Pretoria - Residents of Morula View in Mabopane have shut down all entry and exit points demanding the City remove illegal informal squatters who built shacks within the community. A majority of the protesters are public servants who work as either police, nurses, prison wardens, soldiers and metro police officials. They said the squatters will depreciate the value of their properties, connect water and electricity illegally and make it easy for criminals to get away with crime in the community. The shacks were built at the beginning of August within the community, in a space big enough to be a community park. Next to the shacks are big double storey houses. The people blocked the roads early on Monday morning, saying they do not understand why the squatters would insist on building shacks in a "beautiful and serviced" community. Over 400 mortgage payers are gathered behind the ODI stadium where there are open fields which the squatters planned to occupy.

"The illegal squatters said they will stay here whether we like it or not. They have told us that if we are not comfortable with the shacks we must go and stay in Sandton since we think we are better. "We get that the issue of land and housing is a challenging one but this is not the way to do things. "If we allow them to stay here the next thing they will be burning tyres in the roads demanding services," said one of the community leaders. The police have arrested several community members for public violence. The crowd plans to dump rubble on the roads tomorrow morning, to demonstrate their frustrations. Pretoria News
