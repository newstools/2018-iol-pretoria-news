Nzimande was addressing the national wreath-laying ceremony for fallen traffic officers at the Boekenhoutkloof Traffic College on Friday, hosted by the Road Traffic Management Corporation. He said more and more officers were being hit by motorists who defy orders to stop. The motorists would then speed off. Other officers died after being shot by motorists while conducting roadblocks. Nzimande promised to be tough on motorists who did not obey the law. “We have told our law enforcing officers not to tolerate people who are not following the laws because that is what costs us lots of lives on our roads. “We are also tightening the laws; we will take away the licences of repeat offenders.” He further called upon road users and community members to respect the law enforcement officers as they were there for their safety. Emphasising the importance of the occasion, Nzimande said the day was not only to honour fallen heroes and heroines, but a day to also pay homage to families and remaining traffic officers. “This is our way of saying our heroes and heroines are not only those who appear on television, but are people who ensure that our roads are safe daily,” he said. Motlamedi Mmusi, whose metro police officer husband Tebogo Mathe was run over and killed by a motorist who defied an order to stop in September, said the day was emotional for her. “I never thought I could lose him, especially because he wasn’t sick or anything,” she said. His mother Victoria Mathe, 3-year-old son Lefa and 8-year-old daughter Boago were also at the event.
