The report, titled “The state of inclusive education in South Africa and the implications for teacher training programmes”, was released yesterday by the European Union (EU) and its partners at the Pretoria School for Cerebral Palsied Learners. The report was intended to inform the development of programmes on inclusive education and was a partnership between the EU and Miet Africa, the British Council, Unisa and the Department of Basic Education and Higher Education and Training, to celebrate inclusivity in education. Unisa contributing author Professor Nareadi Phasha said they found out that teachers have a negative attitude towards pupils with disabilities. “They are not prepared or willing to teach them,” said Phasha. Before they could come up with recommendations for inclusive education, they had to undertake the journey of exploring the activity taking place in teacher education programmes, and whether these programmes were preparing teachers to teach inclusively or not, Phasha said. Department of Basic Education chief director Dr Moses Simelane said this report had come at the right time. “We need to prepare our pupils for the fourth industrial revolution, and for skills of the 21st century,” Simelane said.
