Residents and visitors will be spoilt for choice at the 11th edition of the annual festival. It will see different performances from some of the country’s favourite musicians, and plays. The festival started on November 10 and runs until December 15. The State Theatre yesterday announced an additional line-up which includes award-winning play Tau. Co-directed by Thabiso Rammala and Momo Matsunyane, the play follows the main character, Tau, who embarks on a journey of discover- ing his manhood, himself and his Sesotho culture. Meanwhile, the musical Isambulo will again grace the State Theatre stage and take people to church, with a display of the African culture of worship within a typical Sunday church service. This year marks the third time that the musical is dramatised at the theatre. State Theatre spokesperson Thakgatso Setseta said the play had received positive feedback over the years and if city dwellers had not watched it, this was their chance to be wowed. The musical is a clear dramatisation of different churches and it embraces diverse ways in which different churches worship. Plays Montsho and Cado are also in the line-up of the festival with BET award-winning star Sjava sharing the stage with N’gud hitmaker Kwesta. More artists are expected to grace the theatre, among them Vusi Nova, Ringo Madlingozi, Thandiswa Mazwai, Lebo Sekgobela and Dr Tumi. Madlingozi is paired with Nova for a first time duo performance, while Mazwai was said to be returning by popular demand from her stint last year where she set a sold-out house ablaze. For a first at the State Theatre, gospel star Dr Tumi will deliver a message of hope and restoration to audiences, and Sekgobela is another gospel act featured in the line-up. Tickets prices for the shows range from R110 to R200. The music shows range from R200 to R400 and are available at Computicket. People are urged to go to the festival which attracts more than 10000 people annually.
