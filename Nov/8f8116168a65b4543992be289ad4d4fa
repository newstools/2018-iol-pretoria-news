The event will be staged at Unisa’s ZK Matthews Hall in partnership with the German Embassy in Pretoria. Miagi (Music Is A Great Investment) is a public benefit organisation established in 2001 and the Miagi orchestra encompasses its vision of investing in human capacity through music. The orchestra comprises a core of South African musicians, complemented by selected musicians from abroad. Over the next two years Miagi intends to build and run music centres in South Africa starting in Khayelitsha to coincide with the orchestra’s 2019/20 extensive International tour. That programme is part of Miagi’s job-creating initiatives for young South African musicians. Miagi utilises its international profile to attract investment for South Africa and its development work in the country, in areas including community development, education and promoting cultural exchange. Chief executive Robert Brooks said he was inspired by the spirit of Nelson Mandela when he co-founded the organisation with creative manager Ingrid Hedlund: “I had been living abroad for 23 years. Both of us were following our own musical careers. experiencing a new South Africa.” The idea was to unite the power of classical, indigenous and jazz music as a stage for intercultural dialogue through music, said Brooks. He added that Mandela’s message of reaching out to others was desperately needed in the current climate of divisiveness, including the rise of separatist nationalism in Western democracies. “Lively exchange and movement across real borders, and imagined ones, have always at the end of the day been the recipe for success,” said Brooks. Isolationism had throughout history been proven to be ultimately futile. The gala concert roster includes Tshepo Tsotetsi and Visser Liebenberg, among others. Tickets cost R160, R130, R110 and R90 at Computicket.
