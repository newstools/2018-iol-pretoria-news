The National Traffic Information System (NaTIS) was launched by Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande and his Gauteng MEC Dr Ismail Vadi at the Centurion Licensing Services. It is a partnership between the department and the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) and is set to ease the process of applying and promote efficient service delivery, among other things. Vadi said the new system was a step in the right direction. The service will enable ordinary citizens to make their pre-bookings for driving licences, driving licence card renewal and licence tests. “This fits in comfortably with the overall transformation, modernisation and re-industrialisation agenda of the provincial government and demonstrates our commitment to modernising the way in which we deliver services to our people,” he said. Vadi said the system will enhance customer experience, reduce the need to queue for long hours and will also improve service levels at testing centres. Nzimande said people will no longer have to spend an entire day in queues for a service that takes 10 to 15 minutes. “This online booking will definitely shorten the queues and people’s time where they don’t have to take a day off work to queue at the licensing centres. We also hope this will work towards eliminating corruption. “It is known that people pay others to queue for them, while others pay bribes from the security gate to the desk itself, and it happens in many places, but we hope that with the online service you get to be your own master without having to pay a bribe,” he said. The system is currently available only in Gauteng, but Nzimande said they were working towards rolling it out to the rest of the country soon. While Nzimande tested the online booking system, Vadi used the opportunity to renew his driving licence. The service is accessible via online.natis.gov.za
