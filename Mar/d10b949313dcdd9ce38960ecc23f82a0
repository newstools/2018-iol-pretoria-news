Gardiner argued the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee's (Sascoc) refusal to include her was irrational. She asked the court to set it aside and order that she join Grace Legote and Chris-Marie van Wyk who were selected to represent South Africa in this sporting category. Gardiner said she stood a good chance to obtain a medal as she had the best Commonwealth ranking. She said she had fulfilled all the requirements to make the team and that it was unfair to exclude her. Gardiner made it clear she did not want to replace either Legote or Van Wyk, but simply wanted to be included in the team with them. But counsel for Sascoc said this was impossible, as there were only two individual slots for rhythmic gymnastics, which had been filled. Judge Elizabeth Kubushi was told  if she did order that Gardiner be included, it would mean either Van Wyk or Legote had to fall out. The legal arguments began with preliminary points being argued. Sascoc started the proceedings by saying the application was defective as neither Van Wyk nor Legote were joined in the proceedings. It was said if the judge ordered in favour of Gardiner, it would dearly affect them, as they had trained for the Commonwealth Games. Legote is training in Russia and planned on going straight to Australia for the games which start on April 4. The judge was also told that in terms of the Commonwealth Federation allocation system, only 99 South Africans, representing all major sporting codes, were allowed to take part. This total was later upped to 101 and all the places were filled. Counsel for Sascoc also said all the names had to be forwarded to the federation by March 7.
