In addition, more than 210000 litres of water has been collected through the project to help alleviate the impact of the drought in that province. Early this week, the collected water reached the intended beneficiaries, mostly charities. The first beneficiary was Magda Sopkombuis, a soup kitchen in Paarl that  feeds more than 2000 people a week. “This is a fantastic start and we would like to encourage individuals and companies to continue contributing in the months to come,” Jacaranda FM station manager Kevin Fine said. Within two months, boreholes with solar pumps will be installed at schools, benefiting about 700 pupils when the project takes off. The cost is estimated at about R50000 per borehole,which will offer sustainable, meaningful and cost-effective assistance to those in desperate need. Monetary contributions made by companies and individuals will mainly be spent on schools in desperate need of water, with the first borehole set to be installed in June. Fine encouraged more people to keep donating in order to reach more schools:  “With contributions to date via the Jacaranda FM Good Morning Angels account, SnapScan, Ticketpro, City of Tshwane and Adopt-A-School, we have raised R500000 for this cause. This is a fantastic start and we’d like to encourage individuals and companies to please continue contributing in the months to come to enable us to help many more schools." On Saturday, thousands of people heeded a call by the station to fill up Loftus Versfeld Stadium and raise funds for the project  during the match  between the Vodacom Blue Bulls and DHL Stormers.
