For the past three days, Mediclinic employees Lesego Sepeng, Moses Moduba and Khanyisile Ngoetjane, accompanied by their seconds, have run for the worthy cause. Heart Awareness Month is marked annually in the country. It is dedicated to raising awareness about heart disease and risk factors, and the importance of living a healthy lifestyle to prevent the onset of disease. The three have been on the road since Tuesday, and will go back to Brits on Saturday. Yesterday the team arrived at the Medforum Mediclinic in the city, proceeded to Muelmed and stopped at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital. Sepeng, 24, who is a pharmacist at Mediclinic in Brits, began the run alone. He proceeded to Legae Mediclinic in Mabopane and was joined by 41-year-old Moduba. He said: “The main aim is to create awareness for living a healthy and active lifestyle. We are saying to our patients, walking around the block for two days a week for 20 minutes can lower your risk of having heart disease. So we are carrying the message of ‘let’s live a healthy life and take care of our hearts’. “Our slogan for this year is ‘keep it beating’, because you don’t know how many heart beats you still have left.”. Today they will run across the city. Sepeng said the experience had been amazing. “It has been hot. The elements of nature were not on our side, but you know when you have passion for something and a wonderful team behind you, you just play the mental game and tell your legs to shut up and carry on,” he said. Sepeng said he had used his lunch time as well as weekends to train for the run, and that they planned to run again next year.
