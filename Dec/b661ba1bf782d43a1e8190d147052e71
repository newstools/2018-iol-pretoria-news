Led by Chief Khoisan SA, they said yesterday they wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa to give them feedback on the memorandum presented to him last December. They told the media they would not leave until their demands had been addressed and met. Chief Khoisan SA said the public could assist them through sending emails or calling the presidency about their presence at the Union Buildings. He said although the police checked up on them regularly, it was the presidency they needed. Chief Khoisan SA said they had since their arrival used many avenues to appeal to the government to address their demands, but it had fallen on deaf ears. “We as the rightful owners of the land will be taking our country back as natives of this land,” Chief Khoisan SA said. He said they had been subjected to inhuman behaviour over the centuries. “We have not received any communication from the president; we have not engaged in talks; we have been disregarded. “Our demands were put forward, yet the government is pushing for land expropriation without compensation without including us.”
