Department  spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the 29-year-old was supposed to report for duty, but failed to show up. “One colleague who stays in the same complex with him decided to check up on him and that is when he made the gruesome discovery,” Mahamba said. The colleague found the constable’s body with his service pistol next to him. Mahamba said the department was in deep shock and saddened by the loss of yet another member. “An inquest docket has been opened by SAPS for further investigation; however, the possibility of a suicide has not been ruled out,” he said. “We appeal to members of the community who might have any information to contact the nearest SAPS or call 012 358 7095/6.” He said the constable was known as a hard worker, passionate about his work. He was stationed at a drug unit under the crime prevention section at the time of his death. “We are still in disbelief as his death came on a day when the we were burying another constable killed in a business robbery in the past week. We send deeply felt condolences to his family, colleagues and friends.”
