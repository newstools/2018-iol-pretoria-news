The 22-year-old from Soshanguve PP3 hopes the world “sees him” at the 2018 African Wrestling Championships in Nigeria. He is part of the South African Wrestling Federation team departing today to take part in the event which runs from tomorrow to November 11. No fewer than 30 African countries are expected in Port Harcourt. Chochi is no stranger to wrestling tournaments. He has competed in several in South Africa. His recent achievement was when he finished third in the Commonwealth Games last year. He was discovered by his neighbour Kgaogelo Lubisi, after he had gathered all children around Block PP3 who showed interested in the sport and helped them train in a safe manner. It didn’t take much convincing to get the young man to join the Zenzele Wrestling Club managed by Lubisi a year later. Fast forward to today Cochi, who is part of Gauteng North Wrestling, is flourishing. He has done well and highlights the years 2013 and last year as his best. His mother Emily said she remembered the days when the young wrestler started wrestling. She was terrified her son would be injured and would break his bones. “I cringed every time he went to tournaments. I always thought of the worst. But look at him now, he is going places, making our family, community and country proud,” she said. An excited Chochi said: “It didn’t take much convincing to get me into wrestling because I had always watched WWE, and I saw John Cena as my hero.”
