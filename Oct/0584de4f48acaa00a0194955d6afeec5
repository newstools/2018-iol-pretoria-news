Gates open from 11am. Now in its 12th year, the festival is about giving back to the community. And organisers have called on everyone, including corporates, to play their part. Organisers said they introduced a campaign called #DignifyAGirlChild, which is aimed at supporting girls from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing them with sanitary packs. The multi-disciplinary music and lifestyle event has attracted thousands of music enthusiasts over the years. Inspired by 2018 being the year of celebrating the centenary of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu, the organisers said they hoped to give back to the community in a big way. The line-up includes Lady Zamar, Mlindo The Vocalist, DJ Ganyani, Shimza, Blaklez and many others, who have pledged to perform for free in support of the campaign for girls. The festival has been organised by Lamathonsi Entertainment since 2007. Founder and organiser Jerry Nkuna said: “To be part of this year’s event, people are required to pledge three sanitary pad packs. This will get you into the event instead of buying a ticket. “We are calling on everyone - the community at large, companies and government departments - to come and be part of a meaningful cause; we call on political parties to put their differences aside and support a worthy cause; and we call on celebrated names in entertainment, arts and sports to support the #DignifyAGirlChild campaign,” Nkuna said. The sanitary packs will be distributed in schools in the metro and across Gauteng as well as at Thuto Pele High School in North West. Nkuna also assured attendees the event would be filled with entertainment as in previous years. “Being advocates for positive change, in celebrating its 12th year, Lamathonsi Entertainment would like to introduce the campaign to benefit girls from disadvantaged communities."
