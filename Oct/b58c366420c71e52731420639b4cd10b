In its acknowledgement and apology, the Sunday Times recognised that its journalists had been influenced by sources peddling a political agenda, and that its own editorial processes of verification had been flawed. As so-called traditional media, we need to be alert to the risk of publishing misinformation and disinformation. We want our readers to retain their trust in us as credible sources of information about events in their communities and our country, and we should never forget the fantastic work done by honest and committed journalists in highlighting corruption, for example. The Sunday Times case reminds the media industry as a whole of our commitment to you, our valued readers, to be guided by the Press Code which demands that news be obtained “legally, honestly and fairly in accordance with the laws of the country”, and that it be presented “in context and in a balanced manner” reflecting both sides of the story. Those at the Sunday Times who failed this basic test should be held to account because they harmed individuals, and society as a whole.
