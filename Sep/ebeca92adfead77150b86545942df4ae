This time, a woman from Rustenburg claimed R14.5 million from her municipality and the Road Accident Fund (RAF), saying she was left a paraplegic after the car she was in hit a pothole on June 28, 2014. Lilian Pienaar was 17 when she suffered spinal injuries because of the accident. The court ordered that the RAF and Rustenburg Local Municipality were each 50% liable for the damages. The amount of damages owed would be determined at a later stage, her lawyer, Jean-Paul Rudd of Adams&Adams said. According to him, this was a tragic accident which should have never happened if the municipality had bothered to fix the huge pothole. Pienaar was a passenger in a car driven by a Mr N Odendaal when it hit the pothole. Odendaal lost control of the vehicle and it veered into a wall. The severely injured Pienaar was taken to the Job Shimankana Tabane Hospital and later transferred to the George Mukhari Hospital. She had to remain in hospital for months. Despite various back operations, she is now a paraplegic. She also suffered severe psychological shock and trauma. The young woman will be permanently disabled. Her claim included R10m for future medical expenses and equipment to make her life a little easier. This included alterations to her home to make it wheelchair-friendly, and permanent caregivers. While she said the driver should have kept a proper lookout for any dangers in the road, she said the accident would have been prevented if the road had been properly maintained. Tshwane has had its fair share of sinkholes in the past, the most notorious being the Jean Avenue sinkhole in Centurion. The road was only recently opened after months of repair work. The courts have on several occasions held the various municipalities liable for accidents caused by potholes. The judge made it clear in those matters that the municipalities were liable to fix potholes and to maintain the roads within their jurisdictions.
