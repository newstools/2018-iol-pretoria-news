Men and women of the cloth led people from different denominations in a 3km parade to the church in Makgatho Section, where the scourge was strongly condemned by speakers. Sipho Maselane, councillor for Ward 9, where the event was held, was expelled from the ANC after he was jailed in July. He had been convicted on four counts of rape and four counts of robbery with aggravated circumstances in July. Residents of the area will on November 8 go to the polls where political parties are contesting for the vacant seat. Bishop Edmon Zondo from the Assemblies of the Almighty led the sermon. He read from scriptures that motivated people to speak with one voice against wrongdoing, irrespective of their church affiliations. Zondo challenged pastors and other spiritual leaders to always lead by example so that their followers could imitate the good behaviour from them. He encouraged all the law-enforcers to cultivate a fear of God. By so doing, he said, challenges they faced in their line of duty would be defeated. Another spiritual leader, Seeti Makunyane, quoted a verse that said: “If people who are called by my name could come together, humble themselves and pray, I, the Lord, will come down to heal their land.” The occasion was characterised by the singing of gospel songs, clapping of hands and prayers. Speaker after speaker denounced the scourge of robberies, killings and high levels of drug and alcohol abuse that plagued the area. Tshwane council speaker Katlego Mathebe graced the event and condemned the unbecoming behaviour of the local police, who were allegedly complicit in the perpetration of criminal activities.
