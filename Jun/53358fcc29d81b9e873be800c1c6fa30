Pretoria - Matthew Benson, 24, previously accused of murdering Tebogo Ndlovu and disposing of his body, is a free man. The State had alleged that Benson fired shots at Ndlovu, and his friends, on August 2, after the trio from Majakananeng, south of Brits, went to the Mooinooi farm intending to steal scrap metal. Judge JJ Hattingh this morning delivered judgment at the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. “It is found by this court that the State failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. I reject the version of Benny Lerumo, that he was able to identify the accused as the shooter.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

It is clear to the court that Lerumo did not on his own ability, identify the shooter. “Mr Lerumo also did not hesitate to lie under oath in court, as demonstrated earlier in this court’s summation of his evidence. "When one considers the conspectus of the evidence, the court must accept the version he is therefore found not guilty on all charges,” he said. Benson was arrested in September 2017. When Benson took the stand, he testified that he saw two men on his father’s farm that day. He said he called out to them to stop, as they were trespassing. Subsequent to the judgment, Benson said he was happy to be free. “I’m happy and greatful. I believed in my story because that was the truth. It has been an emotional ride for me and God’s pulled me through this whole situation.”  rudzani.matshili@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
