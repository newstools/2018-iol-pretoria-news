CSA and the SABC said the deal gave the public broadcaster exclusive rights to broadcast the matches in the sub-Saharan African region. For the first time South Africa's premier public broadcaster will have exclusive rights to a major cricket event and this is very much in line with CSA’s vision of making cricket a truly national sport of excellence that is accessible to all,” CSA chief executive Thabang Moroe said. SABC chief executive Madoda Mxakwe said the T20 Cricket League would help the broadcaster meet its business objective of attracting audiences and advertising revenue. “It is a good deal, as it fits into the SABC’s business strategy of increasing audiences and revenue by delivering compelling and entertaining content. The deal therefore is one that is mutually beneficial for both the SABC and CSA.” The local T20 league will be played between November and December and will be broadcast live on SABC3, as well as on Radio 2000 and Umhlobo Wenene FM. - African News Agency (ANA)
