GOITSEMANG TLHABYE ERADICATING drugs plaguing Tshwane townships and rehabilitating addicts is not just a pipe dream but something that can be achieved if everyone works hand in hand. And while the City of Tshwane is getting their hands dirty removing the scourge, through announced clean up operations, a dedicated helpline and specialised anti-drug unit, more stakeholders and community members need to come to the fore. Social media activist and former TUT FM breakfast presenter, Khutsi Malala, who has also taken on the drug scourge in his own personal capacity said the 135 addicts he had managed to get into rehabilitation were progressing well. Even though some had left they were still in negotiations to set up programmes for the former addicts to get involved in after they completed. Malala said him and his team were in the final days of launching the Clean Up Squad NPO, which he hopes will be on March 3. For this he said, they were planning on ensuring rehabilitated addicts could participate in media studies and or agricultural programmes with local farmers. Malala also mentioned that he was excited about the second walk they would be doing from Johannesburg to Soshanguve on June 23, with the involvement of local ward councillors and community members once discussions were finalised. “Getting rid of drugs in our communities and winning the fight is possible it just needs everyone to stop turning a blind eye as they know the drug peddlers in their community,”  he said. Malala said he was proud that community members from Rosettenville in Johannesburg had told him they were inspired by his initiatives and have finally taken a stand. “I’m happy that they finally said enough is enough. It is just a pity that has not happened in Soshanguve yet,”  he concluded.
