In a letter written by Willemse’s attorneys to advocate Vincent Maleka, who was tasked with investigating the matter, the former Springbok wing is adamant that racism was the cause of him walking out of the studio during a live television broadcast. Willemse’s attorneys added in the letter that the “narrative perpetuated by SuperSport that there was no racism reinforces his view and infringed his human rights and dignity”. In Maleka’s 50-page report into the matter he states that Willemse “declined” to be interviewed and writes: “The essence of the reasons (given by Willemse) are that the incident was rooted in racism and he informed the CEOs of his submission to that effect.” Willemse was referring to the joint statement made by Khobane and Multichoice CEO Calvo Mawela three days after the incident when - after spending two days discussing the May 19 events with Willemse, Nick Mallett, Naas Botha, and others - they said there was no evidence of racism that could serve as the basis for Willemse’s walkout. Maleka, however, conceded that “this report is impoverished by the absence of Mr Willemse’s version of events". "He is aggrieved by what happened on May 19 and considers racism to have inspired the conduct of his colleagues.” Willemse walked off the set stating he would not be undermined and patronised by Mallett and Botha. In his report, Maleka writes: “I should add that the legal representatives of Mr Willemse conceive the present review process as an attempt ‘to administer a balm (of some sort) to injuries inflicted upon Mr Willemse’s rights to dignity and not to be discriminated against based on the colour of his skin’.” SuperSport cleared Mallett and Botha of racism and backed them to continue in their roles as rugby analysts, but also stated that they’d like to see Willemse return to work.
