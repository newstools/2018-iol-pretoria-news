THE Tshwane Metro Police Department teamed up with City officials to remove illegal electricity connections in Mamelodi. Extension 6 residents said they were tired of their electricity tripping frequently due to the illegal connections made by the neighbouring community. The police found that people from the nearby Phomolong Informal Settlement dug a hole at the corner of Mokabe and Mutshidi streets and installed a pole. These "izinyoka" used heavy current cables and a bracket to intercept a power line to take electricity to their shacks. They then dug the ground to hide the main wire taking current to their community before it was shared by scores of wires connected to numerous shacks. The metro police were deployed to monitor the situation and ensure that City technicians could remove the connections without being attacked or intimidated. Residents said the informal settlement dwellers were aggressive. William Chauke said: "My problem with these people is that they act very aggressive towards us when we confront them about these connections. "They even dug a straight-line hole to hide the main illegal wire connection from our community to theirs. "That hole was even dug across another resident's property and it is dangerous to children. "As residents we ask ourselves where did these people get that thick heavy current cable, the bracket and the pole. "These are material used across Mamelodi by the City. "We think they might be working with some corrupt individuals and that needs to be investigated," he said
