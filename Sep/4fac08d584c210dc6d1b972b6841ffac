During the Junior Africa Challenge Tournament played at the San Lameer Country Club in KwaZulu-Natal, Maimane won the U10 competition last month. He has also been selected for the Gauteng North U13 team that will be competing in the Nomads Tournament. Maimane played his first international tournament in the US when he was only 8. There he finished 41st in a field of 118 players. His mom Lesego said her son first started to play golf when he was 4 years old. “At first we did not really take note of Zinan’s attempts to play golf as his older brother was at the time quite an avid golfer, but as he seemed to lose interest Zinan became more passionate. “There are still times when he gets annoyed when I tell him to stop watching television or playing games as he has to go and train, but the moment he steps on to the golf course everything changes. He does not want to come home. It is always a case of ‘mom, just wait a few more minutes as I just want to hit a few more balls to work on some technique’. Zinan can be quite a perfectionist.” Lesego said the best decision they made was to have Bradley Nienaber (TuksGolf) coach the youngster. “His chipping and putting have improved in leaps and bounds since Bradley started working with him. He also continues to play with greater confidence.” - African News Agency (ANA)
