Welcoming delegates to Adaptation Futures 2018, the world’s leading conference on climate change adaptation, held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre this week, the mayor said the City had to learn many lessons when it came to climate change adaption. “When we talk about climate change, what we have learnt in the City of Cape Town is that what really matters, and how you respond to climate change, what are the actions that you're taking. "You have to act - it’s no use complaining about the impact of climate change when action is needed immediately,” De Lille said. “One thing I can tell you that we have learnt in terms of adaptation is that we have to reduce our water demand and our water usage. "In January 2016, as a collective the City of Cape Town, we used more than 1.1billion litres of water per day. “As we speak today, we have been able to bring down that water consumption to just more than 500million litres of water per day. "So when we are out of the drought, I believe that Cape Town will emerge as one of the most water-resilient cities in the world because of how we had to adapt and how we also had to mitigate all of the challenges.” The 5th edition of the Adaptation Futures conference is taking place for the first time in Africa. It is being attended by more than 1200 delegates from 87 countries and more than 230 organisations, ranging from world-renowned universities, city and regional governments to international funding bodies and NGOs. - African News Agency (ANA)
