Sarah Mothapo and Donald Khoza allegedly conspired with Samuel Kgalakgosi, an officer at Soshanguve Police Station at the time of the tragedy in 2013. Mothapo and Khoza were supposed to learn of their fate yesterday morning. However, they were a no-show. The alleged driver Mothapo faces charges of culpable homicide and failure to assist the injured child. Khoza is accused of defeating the ends of justice by helping to cover up who the driver of the black Jeep Compass was. Kgalakgosi also faces charges of defeating the ends of justice. Olerato was hit by the Jeep outside his grandparents’ home, at Soshanguve Block H, a week after his fifth birthday. His mother Reshoketswe Makena was disappointed that the accused had not taken responsibility for their alleged actions. “I really wanted to see Mothapo's face when the magistrate handed down judgment. Their no-show showed their cowardice, but we hope justice will prevail; they might run but the police will find them. I know they will come up with silly reasons on why they did not pitch.” Makena said she had prepared herself for the judgment and was glad it would finally be over and done with. State prosecutor Kgakgamatso Letsholo however said the failure by the accused to arrive in court would not stand in the way of justice. According to witnesses, Mothapo was driving and had attended an event in the area. They recalled the driver saying, “wait, did I hit something or someone?” before she drove off. The matter was postponed to October 15 for judgment.
