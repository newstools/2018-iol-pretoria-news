Four pupils from Thuto Bohlale High School in Mamelodi displayed more efficiency and bravado during the Pretoria News High School Quiz, qualifying to compete in the regional finals with 29 points.

The pupils prepared under extreme pressure as they only had the weekend. Even so they still managed to qualify for the regional final set to take place on September 1.

The overwhelmed Lebo Kongisa, 16, said they would definitely be bringing the prize home. “We are so happy and excited that we are through to the regionals and we are going to put in more effort and I’m pretty sure that we are going to nail it,” she said. The pupils agreed they needed to put in more effort in the current affairs, business and sport categories. The national winner will take home the title, R20 000 for their school, R5000 for each team member and R5000 for their team coach. There are also prizes for the runners-up and a bursary for a deserving candidate.
