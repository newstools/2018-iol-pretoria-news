President Cyril Ramphosa announced that Ramaite would temporarily take over the reins of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) after the Constitutional Court on Monday upheld a high court ruling declaring Shaun Abrahams’s appointment invalid. Ramaphosa was given 90 days to appoint a permanent NPA head. “This prompt and resolute action will go some way in ensuring that the nation regains confidence in this institution that is extremely critical to the integrity, stability and effectiveness of the criminal justice system,” the ANC said. The Presidency said in a statement: “While the president is studying the judgment, he is committed to appointing a permanent NDPP (national director of public prosecutions) well within the 90 days given by the Constitutional Court for such an appointment to be made. “In the interim, President Ramaphosa has appointed Dr Ramaite as Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions.” Ramaite has been a Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions since 2003. His responsibilities include administration and running the Office for Witness Protection. The advocate had a short stint as acting NDPP in 2015 following the departure of Mxolisi Nxasana before Abrahams was appointed by Ramaphosa's predecessor, Jacob Zuma. The Constitutional Court court on Monday upheld a high court finding that Abrahams’s appointment was invalid, and an order that Nxasana pay back part of the R17.3million golden handshake. Ramaite holds the degrees B.Proc (University of Fort Hare), LL.B; LL.M, specialising in Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Public International Law and LL.D, specialising in Constitutional Law (University of South Africa). He was admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1988 and was granted the status of Senior Counsel (SC) in 2001. - African News Agency (ANA)
