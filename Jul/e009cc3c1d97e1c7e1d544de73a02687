He was speaking to 702 presenter Eusebius McKaiser in his first media interview since his infamous SuperSport walkout in May, after claiming that fellow analysts Nick Mallett and Naas Botha had patronised and undermined him. Last month, SuperSport announced that advocate Vincent Maleka had found no racism was involved in the incident. Instead of heading to court, Willemse said he was now prepared to participate in an SA  Human Rights Commission hearing about his walkout. He said he had been “very clear” to SuperSport that he believed the incident was rooted in racism. He said his pain was legitimate, but that he had reached out to Botha and Mallett since publicly voicing his feelings, based on the premise of reconciliation, and would continue to engage with all parties involved, including SuperSport. Speaking about his past, he described his father's absence in his life as a “presence”. “The nothingness within which I had to try construct an image, a presence, was a dangerous thing for a young man.” - Staff Reporter * To listen to the interview, go to 702.co.za and search for ashwin-willemse.
