And yesterday SA Weather Service forecaster Dipuo Tawana said the seasonal forecast was of above normal rainfall and autumn would be cool with frequent rain. The Department of Water and Sanitation recently recorded a significant improvement in dam levels that left the provincial dam percentages looking good. As such, the rainfall led to the overflow of dams, with the Integrated Vaal River System rising by 1.7% to 89.3% from 87.6% last week. This week's levels were reported to be higher when compared to last year this time when the system was at 86.5%. The river system, which consists of 14 dams, is the economic driver behind Gauteng's growth. Major industries in the province, including Sasol and Eskom, are supplied by the system. But even as dam levels continued to rise, the province was not out of the woods, with the  department saying there was likely to be water shortages if the rate of consumption increased. It urged the public to use the current rainfalls as an opportunity to harvest water and not to rely heavily on the supply of the river system. “This is all because Gauteng is a summer rainfall area and the current levels are likely to fall as chances of rainfalls become fewer moving into the winter season,” the department said yesterday. It said this was the only way to avoid the water shortages experienced last year, which led to water rationing.
