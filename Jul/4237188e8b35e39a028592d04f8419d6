Pretoria - Numerous people have gathered at Church Square in Pretoria to picket against the high general fuel levy at the nearby National Treasury office. The crowd hoped that this demonstration would encourage the government to consider reducing the general fuel tax levy by 20% so that the cost of fuel could be reduced. At the moment, the price of a single litre of petrol has reached a record high of R16 a litre. Moreover, another hike is set to take place tonight. The Freedom Movement, DA and the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) invited civilians and members of the Tshwane taxi industry to take part in the picket. They said, hopefully, a large participation could prompt political will to reduce fuel levies. At least R5 of the money motorists paid for a single litre of petrol went to the general fuel levy. These funds were used by Treasury for various reasons and at least R1 from each R5 went to the Road Accident Fund (RAF).

DA leader Mmusi Maimane said the RAF has failed to use its allocated funds efficiently for the last five consecutive years. The RAF has not hidden that it had financial problems and struggled to payout a lot of claims. Maimane said the government was not interested in reducing the general fuel levy tax - even though it would reduce the cost of fuel - because it used the fund as a cash cow. People are continuing to pour into the square in the city centre to picket. They are joined by various members of the FF Plus, Cope, DA,  Outa, the Freedom Movement and other organisations. The crowd will deliver a memorandum to representatives of the minister of finance, Nhlanhla Nene. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga and DA leader Mmusi Maimane are addressing the crowd. Pretoria News
