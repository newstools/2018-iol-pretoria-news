Pretoria - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) planned to oppose bail applications to be made by two prison warders accused of working with their former inmate to murder magistrate Victor Mabunda, 50, in his Bronkhorstspruit driveway in December. Thomo Michael Ngoato, 42, and Paulos Fourier, 43, told the court through their lawyers that they planned to resume their bail applications on July 9. They abandoned their bail earlier this year while their co-accused, Thato Maringa, who had numerous other cases in different provinces, opted not to apply for bail. NPA prosecutor Advocate Hanna Conradie said the state was going to oppose Ngoato and Fourier’s bail applications because of the seriousness of the crime. He said the trio would be charged with premeditated murder, which was a schedule six offence and such suspects ought to be kept in police custody. Mabunda was presiding over Ngoato’s trial for contravening the drugs and drug trafficking act after he was arrested with dagga that he allegedly sold to inmates at the Baviaanspoort Correctional Centre. It’s believed Ngoato and Fourier met Maringa at the correction service centre while he was their inmate. Mabunda was expected to give his judgement in the case against Ngoato and it could have possibly sent Ngoato to prison. Couradie said the NPA and police were also looking for Solly Sifiso Ngobeni, a person of interest in the case. Ngobeni’s other aliases were, Solly Dlamini and Alias Dinga. The police believe Ngobeni could be in Klerksdorp and any person with information was encouraged not to approach him but to contact the nearest police station or investigating officer Lieutenant-Colonel Andre de Jager on 071 675 6800.
