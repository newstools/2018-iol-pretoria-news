Pretoria - Westbury residents are disappointed and irritated by the disloyal and leniency of Eersterust residents. This follows numerous coloured communities marching to Tshwane House this morning in solidarity with Eersterust residents, to hand over a memorandum on lack of services. Some coloured communities from the province also joined in solidarity and they included Eldorado Park, Ennerdale and Westbury. From the meeting point at Freedom Park to Tshwane House the protesters were hand and glove as they chanted songs together and occupied intersections. But factions surfaced when they reached Tshwane House. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The Eersterust residents instead handed over the memorandum to MMC for Agriculture and Environmental Management, Michael Mukhari. But Westbury residents accused Eersterust residents of being to lenient and disloyal. One Westbury resident said: “The plan was to hand the memorandum to Solly, him and on one else. "Eersterust is soft and will never achieve anything. "We Westbury folk burn and shutdown that’s why the police minister came. They take us seriously,” she said. Another Westbury resident said: “Should I have known that these Eersterust residents are soft and not staunch I would have not joined them. "Peaceful marches never achieve anything. You must destroy in order to build.” The coloured communities were at loggerheads for a a while and even blocked traffic in order to reach a consensus. But chairperson of the Eersterust Action Organisation, Ricardo Terry, said the march was not meant be violent but insightful. “We are here to exercise our democratic right. We need to do that with high moral,” he cautioned.
