Prasa acting chief executive Cromet Molepo told MPs the board could not make it to the meeting as they were only notified on Monday. Department of Transport representative Sipho Dibakwane told the committee there was no confusion, as the invite was sent to Prasa on time and indicated clearly the composition of the delegation. “The problem is with Prasa, not the department and not the ministry.” Acting committee chairperson Leornard Ramatlakane resolved to adjourn for three hours to allow Prasa board members to fly to Cape Town for the meeting but they failed to attend, reasoning that members of the board are in different  places and not able to get to the meeting. Ramatlakane said: “Members are saying we need to compel everybody who is in the Prasa board to come here, and that is by subpoena. That is the decision that the committee is getting to take.” “It is shameful, to say the least, and embarrassing for us to find ourselves in the position we are in to go the route of subpoenaing the board. It shows there is a problem and the only way out of this problem is to look at authorities that are at the disposal of this committee. Why should we get to the stage that we now have to at least seek protection or enforcement from the statute,” added Ramatlakane. Prasa has to provide feedback to the committee on the outstanding 2016/2017 annual report, a draft report on allegations of state capture at the entity, a report on suspension of some Metrorail regional managers and written response to questions submitted to the board in March 2016. Prasa’s supply chain management department has been  implicated in 185 irregular contracts between 2010 and 2016. This is not the first time that the interim board has failed to appear before Parliament. Chairperson of the Prasa board Advocate Tintswalo Makhubele will be the first to be subpoenaed by the portfolio committee. Parliament will issue summons that the board appear before the committee’s meeting next Tuesday.
