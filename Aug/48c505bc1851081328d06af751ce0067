The 12 schoolgirls, fondly known as the “brainy dozen” were selected from their school's Inter-House Quiz as the “cream of the crop” to participate in the first Pretoria News High School Quiz. The quiz next week is part of the National High School Quiz being run by Independent Media’s Daily News in Durban, Cape Argus in Cape Town, The Star in Joburg and Pretoria News in partnership with IIE’s Varsity College. It sees teams of four pupils compete on Monday or Wednesday, with winners going through to a national final in Sandton next month. Grade 11 pupil, Bronwyn Openshaw said she was excited for the quiz. "This will be a great platform to showcase our 'women power' and also befitting because it's Women’s Month," she said. Echoing her sentiments was Grade 10 pupil Oratile Mothibe, who will be their specialist in the category of sports. “Men generally feel like they own sports. My goal for this quiz is to teach them a thing a two about my sports knowledge. This is all in the name of women's liberation.” Newly appointed headmistress, Phillipa Erasmus, herself an “Old Girl” welcomed the quiz because it sought to challenge pupils' minds, encouraging them to stay abreast of current issues in the city. “I'd be lying if I said I didn't want us (PHSG) to win?" There will be two rounds: nine schools in Cluster A will meet at Maragon College, Mooikloof, on August 13. The other nine in Cluster B will compete at Pretoria Boys High on August 15 from 3pm to 5pm. Maragon will welcome teams in Cluster A to its new campus at 652 Eland Street. For details, call 0120035559.
