Tshwane has done well in meeting the growing demand for access to services, but it is a worry that 22% of respondents did not feel the water they get is clean, 17% did not have access to adequate sanitation nor 10% to electricity. And for a city which boasted one of the best wi-fi policies, 36% do not have any internet access. The biennial survey measures satisfaction based on 10 indices, including services provided at all three tiers of government, and the cost and billing for such services. Mayor Solly Msimanga has acknowledged there are lessons to be learnt from the survey. Deserving closer scrutiny is that only 37% of respondents indicated they were satisfied with services provided by the City; satisfaction levels in Tshwane are, generally, lower than in Joburg and Ekurhuleni. The City needs to work with law enforcement agencies to deal with respondentsâ€™ fears over crime, and with drug abuse highlighted as a problem, particularly in Eersterust. It also needs to put politics aside and work closely with provincial government to rectify perceptions that it is falling behind in service delivery. A spokesman for the Joburg mayor, Herman Mashaba, has pointed out that some information in yesterday's Pretoria News report was misleading. The GCRO found that overall satisfaction with local government in Joburg was 4% higher than in the previous survey. Mashaba conceded some areas required improvement and the city was working to improve them. Both DA councils will need to do so if they want to retain control of these metros.
