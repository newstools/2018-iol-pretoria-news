All 27 of them, students, graduates, some ordinary MDC Alliance members and polling agents were arrested during and after the protests. Most were picked up inside the MDC’s Harare headquarters. Many of those arrested had been living in the building trying to help the party capture data from polling stations after the elections two days earlier. They went to the streets before the election results were released, protesting that the presidential election victory had been "stolen" from their leader, Nelson Chamisa, for the MDC Alliance. He had issued many public statements, before during and after the vote, that he had won. Lizwe Jamela, from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, said the 27 have all been charged and will continue with their bail application which they began last Saturday. “We hope to complete the bail process on Tuesday (today).” It is not clear if any others have been arrested in other parts of Zimbabwe, nor how many people have been attacked in their suburbs. The MDC says many of its senior leaders are in “hiding”. It says information about who has been beaten up is still coming in, day by day. In Harare, about seven people were being treated for injuries. Last Wednesday six people died when Zimbabwe National Army troops, called in to assist police, opened fire on unarmed civilian protesters and people who happened to be in the area. Two of them were buried in Harare at the weekend. A further seven were injured, three seriously. President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he will hold a public inquiry about the army involvement in the deaths. The MDC will apply to the Constitutional Court to set aside the results of the poll in which Chamisa won 44.3% of the vote.
