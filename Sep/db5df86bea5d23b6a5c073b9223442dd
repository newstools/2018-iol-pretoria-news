There are scenes of jubilationÂ on the Twitter streets after the Constitutional Court on Tuesday ruled that it was legal to cultivate and consume dagga for personal use. In a unanimous judgment, the highest court in the land has decriminalised the private use of dagga. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, announcing a unanimous verdict, said that certain sections of the legislation covering the use of cannabis was unconstitutional. Zondo pointed out that Parliament had 24 months to repeal laws that banned smoking and cultivation of dagga in private homes.

Twitter users have since taken to the platform to celebrate following the decision, creating countless memes. Here are some of the memes we found hilarious:
