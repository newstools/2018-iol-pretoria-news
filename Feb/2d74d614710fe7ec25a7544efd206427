Yesterday the gates remained locked and the yard looked as if had not been cleaned for a while. Joachim Giesel said his son, who lives in the area, had said Les Marais was the only pool that operated perfectly. He said the biggest problem was that it was closed on hot weekends and during school holidays. But the closure was a huge blow because his son’s school trained at the pool. He had questioned staff about the closure and they said it was due to not being paid overtime. “It is unreal that a pool that was functioning properly would be closed down in this heat; besides, my son’s school trains in that swimming pool. “The City did not communicate with the school that the pool would be closed, and it being the only swimming pool in the area has left our children stranded.” He said not everyone had the luxury of going to privately-managed Pretoria north swimming pools to cool down or for recreational purposes. He pleaded with the City to open Les Marais. “As ratepaying citizens in this area, we would appreciate some speedy resolution to this problem,” he said. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said the pool being closed "did not help" when temperatures in the city were at their highest. “The pool was operating just fine and suddenly we would sit outside waiting for it to be opened, and unfortunately no one came. Nothing was communicated to us about the closure,” he said. But City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo denied the claims of staff not being paid overtime, saying the closure was due to a shortage of chlorine. “The pool is in good condition and operational, we are just awaiting supply of chlorine. “As far as we know, overtime has never been an issue,” Mashigo said. He said once the chlorine was delivered the pool would open to the public. “The pool will be opened in due course. We apologise for the inconvenience caused, but we can assure people that we are working tirelessly to ensure that the pool is re-opened soon.”
