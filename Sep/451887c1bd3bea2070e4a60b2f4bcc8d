The university said the birth resulted from a research study by a team of scientists from the university on the reproductive physiology of the female African lion and the development of artificial insemination protocols for this species, which could be used as a baseline for other endangered large wild cats. Although African lions normally breed well in captivity, the wild population is highly fragmented and suffers progressively from isolation and inbreeding. Indiscriminate killing, habitat loss and prey depletion, diseases, poaching and trophy hunting threaten the extinction of these existing wild populations. The African lion population is estimated to have decreased from 1.2 million in 1800 to about 25000 in 2016, and 18000 in 2018, a reduction of more than 98% over 220 years and more than 60% in the last 25 years. The African lion is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species, with the West African lion sub-population considered critically endangered. The research team now had novel data for the African lionâ€™s reproduction physiology, said Dr Isabel Callealta, a PhD candidate at the university. African News Agency (ANA)
