Other South African sprinters who have managed to break the 10-second barrier in this event are Simon Magakwe (9.98 seconds) in 2014; in 2015 Akani Simbine and Henricho Bruintjies both ran 9.97; in 2016 Wayde van Niekerk ran 9.98 and last year Thando Roto clocked 9.95s. Judging by what happened over the past weekend Erasmus looks set to continue the proud tradition. At the recent Resisprint Meeting in Switzerland, he ran 10.01 in the semi-final. In the final, his time was 10.02. What made his performance notable was that the two races were within three hours of each other. The week before in Copenhagen, Denmark, Erasmus clocked 10.11 which shows he's definitely in form. But then again to improve by 0.03 over 100m doesn't just happen overnight and Simbine can vouch for that. Frans van Rooyen, who coaches Erasmus, admits that his athlete is in for a tough challenge to find the extra speed to improve by a mere few hundredths of a second. He however believes the secret to doing so lies in the execution of the race. “Any good athlete should know what to do from the start to the finish of his race. "If he doesn't, it's a waste of time," said the coach. “One of the reasons why Emile is continuously getting faster is because he can remember exactly how he executed each of his races. “Afterwards, he knows what he did right and where he erred, and that makes a big difference. "Emile doesn't have to ‘reinvent the wheel’ when he races - it's a case of adjusting small things in his technique. “Emile chose to keep on sprinting because he believes he has what it takes to become a top international sprinter who can go under 10 seconds and he's goal-driven. “Once he has put his mind to something, he won't stop until he's achieved what he's set out to do.” - African News Agency (ANA)
