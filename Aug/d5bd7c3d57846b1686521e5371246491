Serious concerns about the high volume of foreign patients consulting at the hospital came under the spotlight during a visit by MEC for Health Dr Gwen Ramokgopa yesterday. Ramokgopa said public health facilities in the province were owed R160million by foreigners. “We make sure that we send bills to the embassies of their countries. However, the response is that embassies never sent the patients here,” she said. Ramokgopa said her department was working closely with the Department of International Relations and Co-operation to help. “We do issue the invoices and I am happy that one or two are starting to pay. I think we must put pressure on the embassies and they must take responsibility." According to hospital staff, at least 70% of those coming to the hospital every month were foreigners, which impacted negatively on their workload. Ramokgopa was there to interact with women at maternity wards as part of her Women’s Month programme. “My message is that we as women of South Africa and people of South Africa must call upon the leaders of other countries to prioritise services for pregnant mothers to deliver next to home. Some women get on to the back of trucks just to come here and survive pregnancy and give possibilities for their children to survive.” It also surfaced that some patients were forced to sleep on the floor due to a shortage of beds in the wards. Dr Edwin Mnisi said: “The biggest problem at the moment is overcrowding of patients because sometimes we have patients who are sleeping on the floor because we don’t have space to accommodate them.” Mnisi suggested that the department ought to initiate a memorandum of understanding with other hospitals to enable it to deal with only high-risk cases. Other patients complained about a lack of blankets and linen to keep them warm during cold weather. Pretoria News
