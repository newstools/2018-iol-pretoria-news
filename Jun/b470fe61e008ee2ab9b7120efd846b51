Passengers were alerted about cable theft in the early hours. A shuttle service was introduced between Hatfield and Centurion, but the Centurion and Park station section was not affected. Later, Gautrain issued an update that the cables had been repaired: “All trains are now operating according to schedule. Thank you for your understanding,” read the messages at midday. But what annoyed some passengers was an alert that there had been a delay yet again in the afternoon. “Unfortunately the delay time between Hatfield and Park stations is extended to approximately 25 minutes. This is due to a train that has failed. We will continue to provide updates.” On Twitter, @da_nhla said: “Your service is appalling, especially for the price you charge, now you want an extra R1 to let everyone know about your pathetic service. What is the purpose of the app now since it was your way of communicating? “With so much money that we pay for your service, you cannot even look after your own infrastructure all you know is bringing guards on board to look out for people eating, chewing, useless!” @KK_Maitisa said: “This has been happening an awful lot of times between April and now. What measures are being taken? The Gautrain fare has gone up but your service is going down. We pay too much money for this to keep happening.” Some said cable theft kept popping up. @Zuleikha_Riaz: “This ‘cable theft’ is becoming a weekly thing and it always seems to be delaying the trains on Mondays. Some of us have exams, meetings and other important things to do instead of standing down here for 45 minutes.” @MamsyChabangu: “#Gautrain is starting to become unreliable public transport. I had to drive from Pretoria to Rosebank, this is happening quite often because of so-called ‘cable theft’.” Gautrain management apologised for the inconvenience caused.
