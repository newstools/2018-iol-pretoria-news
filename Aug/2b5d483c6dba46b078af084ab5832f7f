Grizzly details of how the decomposed body of 14-year-old Keleabetse (Kele) Seleka was found in a pit toilet in Brazzaville, west of Pretoria, on Monday emerged from the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. It was established via DNA testing that the body was indeed that of Kele, who went missing on November 28, 2016, exactly a month before her body was found. Her hands were tied together with wire, while her feet were also bounded in a similar manner. A black shoelace was still tied around her neck. Kele responded to a Facebook invitation by a blesser, who called on young curvaceous girls to bless. She left her parental home in Centurion via taxi and went to Brazzaville to find her “blesser”.  She never returned and her body was only discovered a month later in a pit toilet. The blesser turned out to be John Lekubu, 31, who is facing an array of charges, including murder, with his co-accused Tebogo Mabulana, 32, Lesole Mashao, 26 and Eugene Machete, 24, all of Brazzaville. The four denied all the charges against them. Sergeant Lebohang Monareng, who was at the time the investigating officer in the case, said Lekubu pointed the toilet out to him. He saw something resembling a body deep down in the toilet, but the structure had to be demolished before they could get to it. “When we retrieved the body, which was wrapped in two curtains and black bags, it was covered in flies and the stench was terrible. We could not establish then whether it was a male or a female.” It was established the next day during the autopsy that it was the body of a young female, tied-up with plastic coated electrical wire. Monareng said the toilet where the body was found, was about 15 meters away from the shack where the accused stayed. Proceeding
