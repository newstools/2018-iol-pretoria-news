Pretoria - EFF leader Julius Malema is currently inside Brooklyn Police Station to open a criminal case against the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. He was accompanied by EFF secretary general Godrich Gardee and national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Malema said he planned on opening a handful of charges against Gordhan. On Monday Gordhan laid charges of defamation against Malema for a series of taunts by himself and EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu, which included labelling Gordhan a dog of white monopoly capital”. Malema made the comments on November 20, while addressing party supporters protesting outside the offices of Tiso Blackstar, where the state capture inquiry hearings are taking place.     Reacting to the ongoing insults on Monday, Gordhan denounced Malema’s comments as hate speech and added that he would not allow corruption to be masked by racism or allow personal attacks on him and his family. “The determined defence of corruption and the corrupt, using personal attacks, racism and alleged hate speech is not acceptable and must be challenged," Gordhan said, as he announced he would seek R150 000 in damages. “I have not responded until now to the absolute nonsensical and unsubstantiated attacks, but extending these attacks to my family and threatening harmony amongst the people of South Africa was a step too far. Enough is enough.” Hundreds of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) gathered outside the Brooklyn police station singing and chanting since early Tuesday morning. Pretoria News
