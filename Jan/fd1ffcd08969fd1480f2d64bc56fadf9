A report from the eThekwini Parks, Recreations and Culture department presented this week indicates the need to honour the two Struggle stalwarts. This comes after the country celebrated the OR Tambo centenary last year and is set to honour the Mandela centenary this year. “As one of the biggest cities in South Africa, eThekwini does not have any memorial of significant stature honouring the contribution made by both OR Tambo and Nelson Mandela, except (for) the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine and a Nelson Mandela statue which is at Ohlange.” Ohlange is a high school north of the city where Madiba voted for the first time. This decision on the new statues was approved by the eThekwini executive committee with only the IFP representative abstaining pending consultation with members of his caucus. The matter will now go to council for final approval, but with the ANC the majority party in council, and the DA supporting the plan, it is effectively a done deal. A more comprehensive report on the financial implications of the project will be submitted to council later. The projected cost of R13m, includes production of the statues, installation and unveiling 
ceremonies. The report does not however, indicate where the statues will be erected. According to the report, a number of organisations and individuals have been consulted about the project. These include local universities, the Durban Art Gallery, the BAT centre, Phansi Museum and the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Trust. There will now be a public consultation process. The report indicated that once the statues were installed, programmes would be established as the statues form part of the city’s efforts to transform its heritage landscape. Pretoria is one of the cities with a Mandela statue, unveiled at the Union Buildings in 2013, while one for Tambo was unveiled at the OR Tambo airport last year. - Staff Reporter
