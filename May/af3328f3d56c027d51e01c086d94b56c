The Tuks gymnast, along with Siyabulela Siwa, Luka Angileri en Enzo Henning, won gold in the team competition. The 14-year-old was fourth in the individual double mini-competition. Van Staden, who is doing homeschooling, said the only real exercise he did two years ago was bouncing around on a mini-trampoline at home. His mom suggested that he should take it up as a sport. Former African Champion Lucky Radebe was hired as coach of Van Staden at the Tuks trampoline club. He has become an astute student of the sport often training long hours. - African News Agency (ANA)
