Phakeng, who is UCT deputy Vice-Chancellor for Research and Internationalisation, takes over from Dr Max Price - UCT’s vice-chancellor since 2008 - on July 1. Her appointment is seen as a move for further transformation of the university which has been embroiled in the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMust Fall student protests in recent years. UCT council chair Sipho Pityana said the council was confident that Phakeng will provide academic, strategic, transformational and ethical leadership and vision for the institution. “The council made the decision to appoint Professor Phakeng following a competitive selection process. “We trust her to lead the institution in pursuing its 2016-2020 strategic plan, which she was involved in developing.” He said she had “knowledge and understanding of the key challenges and opportunities arising from the changing higher education environment in South Africa and globally.” Phakeng said she was honoured by the opportunity and support and knew her task of leading the world-class institution was complex. She committed to working tirelessly to enhance cutting-edge research, develop talented academics, staff and students and ensure UCT was “a phenomenal international experience. We will rethink curricula and make sure we broaden our pursuit of excellence in research, teaching and learning and in all our activities”. Social Justice in Education (SJE) welcomed the appointment of a black woman to the position, while Professor Adam Haupt, speaking on behalf of the Black Academics Caucus (BAC), described Phakeng as an excellent scholar and dynamic leader. Education activist Hendrick Makaneta said the appointment showed transformation was taking place, and Phakeng would take the university to greater heights. “In her term as associate mathematics educator for South Africa, she took education to greater heights.” He believed she would “listen to the grievances” on campus and accelerate transformation.
