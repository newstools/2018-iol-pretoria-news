TRIBUTES are pouring in for rapper Jabulani Tsambo better known by his stage name  HHP who died this afternoon. Speaking to TsishaLIVE, HHP's wife and famed publicist Lerato Sengadi confirmed that the well-known SA rapper had in fact died. "Yes, yes it's true. I am with the family at the moment," said Sengadi. At this time the details around his death are still unclear. However, the rapper did have a history of depression. He completed his high schooling at St. Alban's College in Pretoria. He was initially part of a group called Verbal Assassins, working closely with producer Tebogo Rameetse. In 1997, he and his school friends met with producer Chicco Twala who produced their debut album, Party. However, the band split soon after the release of Party. Pantsula had his next album, Introduction, produced by singer and producer Isaac Mthethwa, and recorded in different South African languages such as Setswana, isiZulu and Sesotho.
