The case was postponed to December 13 to enable Maluleke to make representations to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regarding the criminal charges against him. Maluleke appeared in court last month together with former head of the Hawks Anwa Dramat and erstwhile Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya. Charges were at the time provisionally withdrawn against Dramat and Sibiya, but the prosecution said it was set on proceeding against Maluleke. Prosecutor George Baloyi told the court the case was postponed last month to appoint an instructing attorney for Maluleke via the office of the State Attorney. This was after the State agreed to pay for his legal fees. Maluleke is facing several charges, including seven of kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and contraventions of the Immigration Act, following the rendition of several Zimbabwean nationals in 2010 back to their place of birth. They were wanted for the alleged murder of a top police officer in Zimbabwe. Maluleke is out on R5000 bail.
