Member of the Mayoral Committee for Agriculture and Environmental Management Mike Mkhari said a team of workers had been beefed up to clean up surroundings in different parts of the municipality. He said the City would make sure that all illegal dumping sites were protected to prevent people from illegally dumping again. “We don’t want to continuously clean and then people illegally dump again,” he said. To complement the clean-up efforts, Mkhari said the City would soon implement a programme called Adopt a Spot. Through the programme, people would be encouraged to take care of unoccupied spots in their surrounding, he said. According to him, the aim of the programme was to assist the City to protect some unoccupied places from illegal dumping. “Those who wanted to adopt a spot can apply to the City for permission to do so. People can plant grass on that spot, take care of it, but are not allowed to erect a structure,” he said.
