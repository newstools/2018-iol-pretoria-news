The role is portrayed by South African Film and Television Awards (Safta) winner Bongile Mantsai, 33, and is driven by revenge. It has been stirring up viewers’ emotions since his debut. Mthunzi is charismatic and charming, but also a chameleon who quickly changes colours depending on what he needs from people. He is best known for his role in the controversial film Inxeba, but since his debut on Scandal, viewers take to social media to discuss it every day. In the e.tv series, he is the son of domestic worker Dambisa Maduna, who works for the rich Langa family, but none of the family members knows it. He hates the family after he once, as a child, visited his mother at work and had a bad experience there. This left him feeling unwanted and disrespected and he grew up to resent them. So to get back at them Mthunzi kidnapped and killed businessman Siseko Langa (Hlomla Dandala), out of revenge and to get to his millions. He faked his way into running the law firm Langa had put his son Chumani (Ayanda Daweti) in charge of. Soon after he had the Langas eating out of his hand, becoming the chief executive, but leaving Chumani in doubt of him. He even manipulated his way to the heart of Chumani's sister Xolile’s (Sivenathi Mabuya), and they will be getting married soon. People have expressed mixed emotions about the character, with many saying they were impressed with him, but it was time for him to get caught. @zytiso said: “Whoever came up with Mthunzi’s story line should be given a Safta for great manipulator and liar... bathong, this guys can get out of any situation and come out tops.” @Brodukzela wrote: “Mthunzi the master manipulator” while @ntokomduna said it was time for Mthunzi to get caught. “I’m so tired of this guy why can’t they catch him already” Viewers have also commended the writers. @numbz_lelo wrote: “Scandal (e.tv) has never been this interesting".
