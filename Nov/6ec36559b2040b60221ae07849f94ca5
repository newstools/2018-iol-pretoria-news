The service to the township was halted last Monday following threats that buses would be torched by passengers who were unhappy that they were always overcrowded. About 8000 commuters were forced to use alternative transport following the stoppage. Sam Matabane, chief executive of A Re Yeng operator Tshwane Rapid Transit, said despite having added two buses following the stoppage, overcrowding remained an issue. “We’ve been in talks with the City and will need a longer contract to be able to add more buses to the route. We added two more train buses, but the overcrowding persists,” he said. Tshwane Rapid Transit took over the route for six months while the province advertised the tender. However, no service provider was found and thus the agreement was extended. The City and taxi industry were last week set to sign a bus company operating agreement to ensure improved services but was postponed. The City’s A Re Yeng buses took over the Mamelodi route last year after Autopax declined to renew its contract with the provincial government. Autopax, a state-owned transport entity, had been requested by the provincial Department of Roads and Transport to step in after Putco voluntarily surrendered its contract to the provincial government in 2015. The company had lost 19 buses to fires during unrest ahead of the local government elections of 2016.
