He was due to answer questions from MPs last week but it had to be postponed indefinitely as a result of his absence. The DA said it accepted that Mabuza was not well, but his parliamentary duties were not being met. “As the leader of government business, he is responsible for the affairs of the national executive in Parliament and the programming of parliamentary business. This is not being done and it does not bode well for accountability." It asked what the citizens were expected to think when the man meant to step in for the president if he was out of the country or indisposed, was so indisposed that he was unable to manage the affairs of his own portfolio. “Mabuza has been absent for the better part of the third parliamentary term.” Since it was announced that he would take sick leave on October 25, the deputy president has also missed the keynote address to the Chilean Parliament by National Council of Provinces Speaker Thandi Modise. The Presidency only said Mabuza would “take a few days sick leave” and did not elaborate. The DA said Mabuza must "reveal full information on his sick leave”. Pretoria News
