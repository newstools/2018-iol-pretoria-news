The 16-year-old also wants young women in her Soshanguve community to advance further and empower themselves. The Grade 11 pupil at Christian Progressive College in the city centre is affectionately known as “Happy Feet” because she does every activity at her school. She initiated a debate team at the school and has held the title of best speaker for 2016 and 2017. She co-founded a sanitary pads foundation with her English teacher. While in Grade 9, she was awarded the model pupil of the year award. “At school they call me Happy Feet because I’m always all over the place. I don’t miss activities. If there is a dance group or acting team they know I’ll be part of the team. “The award for model pupil of the year was for a special student who had set a good example for other pupils the entire year. I make sure to always get myself into the top achievers' category at the end of each academic year and strive and aspire to make my family and loved ones proud,” Victoria said. She described herself as a well grounded girl from a traditional family and was interested in performing arts, debating or public speaking and politics. She occasionally performed at the State Theatre, but was afraid to enter pageants; this was until her mother entered her into a pageant in 2014. “I loved how at pageants the girls would dress up and do charity work. In 2014 my mother entered me into a pageant on my behalf. I ended up not being crowned, but that made me want to enter more pageants. “Early in 2017 I entered Miss Sun City Classic FC 2017 unfortunately I didn’t do well and barely made it to the top 30. “I never gave up, and in 2017 I entered Miss Inspire South Africa Teen 2018 and am in the top 12.” The winner will be crowned on March 24, and Victoria believes she has a good chance of winning. Her charity work includes visiting old age homes, hospitals and giving empowering talks to girls her age in her community.
