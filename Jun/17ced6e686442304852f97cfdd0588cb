"You also don't want to go to your social media accounts because the thing with using free WiFi is that someone can intercept the traffic, encrypt it and find out what your password is and due to that they compromise your private information.

He advised that people should rather use a private network application which allowed ones communication, from their laptops to any service which they are browsing, is in a secure tunnel where if anyone attempts to intercept the traffic on a local WiFi network it will not be able to understand what you are doing on the network.
