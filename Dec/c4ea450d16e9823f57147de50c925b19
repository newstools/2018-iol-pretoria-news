IT is now official that the City of Tshwane will not host its traditional New Year's Eve celebrations at Church Square. The City said it regrets to inform its residents that it won't be hosting the planned traditional New Year's Eve celebration after the appointed service provider pulled out at the 11th hour, leaving their plans in disarray. “Despite this setback, we tried to enlist the services of other bidders with a view to salvaging the event, but their quotes were obscenely exorbitant and it was short notice to pull off an event of that magnitude.” “In our endeavour to salvage the event, we were mindful of the appropriated budget for the event, and as a responsible administration, we wouldn't exceed the budget to host the event at all costs, to the taxpayers' detriment.” The City has been hosting the celebration for many years and it was one of the marquee events hosted by the city to usher in the New Year. “We wish to apologise profusely to the revellers that were already looking forward to enjoying the music bonanza on Monday, December 31 2018. "We hope our residents would explore other alternatives to cross-over to the new season,” the City said in a statement.
