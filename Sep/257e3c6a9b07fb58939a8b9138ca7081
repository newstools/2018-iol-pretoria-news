As part of this year’s Standard Bank Joy of Jazz - from yesterday to tomorrow - at the Sandton Convention Centre, a dynamic installation will highlight Masekela’s life and work, and honour his invaluable contribution to the South African and global music landscape. Named No Borders, a title which references his last studio album, the installation portrays the famous musician’s artistic journey; one that was expansive, prodigious, creative and global. It illuminates his infinite love affair with music and humanity. The installation features an array of his horns, portraits and his music, evoking the man’s indomitable spirit as he took his music through borders and gave the world his distinctive sound. His creative works included a myriad music, including anti-apartheid songs such as Stimela and Bring Him Back Home, beautiful ballads such as In the Marketplace, jazzified traditional South African music like Umhom, Bajabula Bonke, and of course the international hit, Grazing in the Grass, a US No 1 pop hit in 1968 and perennial summer song. Masekela played with everyone; from The Byrds to Dave Grusin, unrecorded nights with Fela and seemingly knew every musician in the world from Salif Keita to Keiko Matsui. The No Borders installation is curated by multimedia artist Moratiwa Molema, and the Masekela Family. The Joy of Jazz festival and the Sandton Convention Centre are honoured to host this memorial to a true son of the soil and child of the globe. Jennifer Bruce
