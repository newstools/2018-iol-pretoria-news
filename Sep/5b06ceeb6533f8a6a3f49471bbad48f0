The award, presented by the Wildlife and Environmental Society of South Africa (Wessa), is in recognition of the commitment by Cape Town’s environment management department and its implementing partner, the Friends of Blaauwberg Conservation Area. “The event is in recognition of work put into preserving the unique flora and fauna along its coastline, while providing opportunities for environmental education, sustainable tourism and the empowerment of local communities,” said national coastal co-ordinator Robert Slater. The Green Coast Status Award flag was also presented to the nature reserve. Green Coast is Wessa’s newest eco-label awarded to coastal sites in South Africa where a sensitive species, habitat or cultural heritage site is being sustainably managed, leading to increased tourism along the coastline. The Blaauwberg Nature Reserve has shown ongoing commitment to conserving and monitoring its sensitive coastal areas and maintained a high standard set out by the Wessa Green Coast criteria. “Wessa Green Coast was developed and implemented by Wessa and is awarded for effective conservation management of sensitive coastline through monitoring, environmental education and responsible tourism,” Slater pointed out. “This is a very exciting time for South African tourism and especially as this will be the first site in the country to be awarded the prestigious Wessa Green Coast status,” he said. The mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said communities played a vital role in protecting our biodiversity. “As the most biodiverse city in the world, we have a responsibility to conserve and protect this unique biodiversity, but we cannot do it alone,” he said.
