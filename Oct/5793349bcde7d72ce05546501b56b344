They will be joined on stage by cast members, Jade Meyers, Thato Monoe, Elizabeth Sebesho and Ponatshego Malebye.

The former Generations actor and his son earlier took some time to chat to the Pretoria News about what it meant to finally perform together. They were at the State Theatre where the play will be taking place, rehearsing. They both said they knew how to juggle between professional and personal relationships. Thabiso plays the role of Jason: “The story is about a guy named Jason who just lost his son because of the way the generational passings of teachings he got from his father were not working in the new world. "The wife decides the best way to end this madness is to kill my son.” "With the play, Seputla the story of how women were ready to rule would be told. “This kind of theatre is open...It is a way for me to say this is the time for us men to open doors for women to conquer and not because they are women but because they are capable.” Sharing a stage had been a dream for a long time, they said. The play offers an experimental multimedia theatre experience from the perspective of men in the current changing world. It's due to premiere on the 20th and run till the 28th of October.
