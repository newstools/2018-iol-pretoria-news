The streets were alight with colourful clothes, shoes, hats and accessories as well as floats. The parade was scheduled to start from Fountains Valley Heritage Museum entrance, but there were so many groups that some had to convene at other locations and join in as the parade moved on. Others were dropped off at the Union Buildings by bus. DJs played music along the route while international representatives and officials from embassies, stunning in their colours and traditional attires, joined in . Led by Premier David Makhura and Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga, the carnival was treated to live performances from a diverse line-up of musicians. “It doesn’t matter whether you were born in Europe or America because all human beings originate from Africa. So when we celebrate Heritage Day, we are celebrating our common humanity together as a people,” Makhura said.
