BLIND people were still at the receiving end of social injustice, the South African Blind Youth Organisation in Gauteng province (SABYO) spokesperson Calvin Tshehla has said. Tshehle spoke to the Pretoria News this morning during their march to the Union Buildings to submit a memorandum of issues affecting people with visual impairments. SABYO members convened at the Art Museum. Education, employment, complete economic emancipation, housing, sport, transportation and road safety are areas of concern. He said: “Blind people are still marginalised. It seems like democracy is a luxury to people who are blind.  rudzani.matshili@inl.co.za  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The government just addresses the disability as social welfare and a medical concern, they just provide people with basic grants.” Tshehle said their education system made it impossible to contribute to both politics and the economy. “As you know education provides knowledge and skills to blind people in order to access a range of human rights such as the right to contribute to politics and the economy. “We think that in terms of the education that is received by blind people, they don't have adequate devices,” he said. In addition, Tshehla said visually impaired students in tertiary institutions received their study devices only in September. Marchers have reached their destition and are waiting to be addressed by a representative from the Presidency.
