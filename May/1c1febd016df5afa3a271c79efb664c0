The MEC did a walk-about of the public health facility for the visit, which was in solidarity with nurses and doctors on Workers' Day (May 1). The doctor and politician observed the facility and its operations before asking patients and nurses about the resources they still needed to enhance service delivery. In response, Dr Bahupeleng Mashaba said she was happy with most things and was able to assist patients every time she went to the hospital. However, she told Ramokgopa that the clinic could use a few more nurses and health equipment to speed up healthcare service delivery. Patient Siyabonga Hendricks said she travelled from Phomolong to take her 2-year-old daughter, Sibabalo, for a routine check-up. She was assisted by Ramokgopa, and watched her conduct a thorough check-up of her daughter. “I am happy to see the MEC here to help and also talk to us. It shows she is still a good doctor even though she is now a politician. “I could not think of anything to tell her to improve at the clinic because I am happy with the current state,” said Hendricks. Ramokgopa said she hoped her visit would encourage workers across the country to perform their duties with pride and the utmost dedication. Ramokgopa said she chose Stanza Bopape because she had received calls from community leaders about unbearably long queues. This was not her first visit to the clinic. “As you can see, there is increased security at this clinic because there was a person who came here bringing a patient, and assaulted a clerk. I am happy with how things are now,” said Ramokgopa. Clinic manager Sammy Ntshileng said the assault occurred at night over the Easter weekend, and that management had opened a case against the culprit. Security officers now conduct thorough checks on every vehicle entering and exiting the clinic's premises.
