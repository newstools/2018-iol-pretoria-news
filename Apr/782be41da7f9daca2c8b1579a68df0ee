This follows a successful fund-raising golf tournament hosted by Ayepyep Restaurant and Lifestyle Lounge at Wingate Park Country Club on Friday that managed to raise a whopping R100000 to assist the struggling orphanage. This first annual golf day was part of their corporate social investment project to give back to the community. Founder of the orphanage Titus Sithole, who also played golf for the first time during the event, said the money would go far in easing the pressure on them, especially with winter approaching. “The money is going to help with winter clothes, food and infrastructure,” said Sithole. The orphanage has been operating from 2005 as a project run under the Ministry of Charity and Faith Missions. The home started with five children. It is licensed to house 36 children but have 24 aged between 7 and 18 years old. The children also attend school on the premises. Co-owner of Ayepyep Kagiso Setsetse said growing up in Mamelodi and being one of seven children raised by a mother who was a domestic worker, he empathised with the orphans. “I know the pain of going to bed not fully fed and experiencing unbearable winter seasons,” Setsetse said.
