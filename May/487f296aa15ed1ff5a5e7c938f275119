MATLHATSI DIBAKWANE Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane hosted two Pretoria High School for Girls learners at her Hatfield Offices. As part of the 2018 Cell C Take a Girl Child to Work Day and the #Morethanaday campaign which took place nationwide on May 24. Excited to walk besides Mkhwebane, Anathi Sago and Palesa Selepe grabbed the opportunity with both hands by asking how they should tackle being women leaders in a world which idolises patriarchy. Sago said: “I didn't know the Public Protector's work needed so much attention and so many people lodged complaints which means every single file has to be checked.” Selepe said: “The Public Protector has many people behind her, it's not all about her but about teamwork. As a woman leader she taught me to be resilient and keep pushing to be educated while I’m still young.” Cell C’s Take a Girl Child to Work Day has become one of the most important life changing campaigns for schoolgirls around the country. Mkhwebane said she wants to instill the spirit of working hard in young girls but also not forgetting the boys. “While we rally behind the girls, we must not forget to empower the boys also because they need our attention as they will end up being besides the very same girls we mentor today,” the public protector said. The Cell C Take a Girl Child to Work Day celebrates its 16th anniversary this year. The Public Protector's office recognised the powerful impact it had on the lives of many girls, preparing a core of future women leaders who will be vibrant contributors to the economy and leading job creators for the country.
