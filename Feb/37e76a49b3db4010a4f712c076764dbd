Passengers can now register their Gautrain cards and reload funds on the internet, which will save them quite a lot of time in queues at the station. However, they will still have the option to buy cards or top them up at any Gautrain station. The new website and mobile application will allow them to create a profile from where they will be able to manage their ticketing and trips online. Another feature on the new Gautrain website and mobile application is the trip planning tool which assists passengers to locate the nearest Gautrain station, plan their route, and check the Gautrain timetable. The app gives information on the bus options, and calculates the cost of a trip. Go to www.
