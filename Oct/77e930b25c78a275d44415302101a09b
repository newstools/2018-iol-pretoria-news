DURBAN – International airline British Airways has been recognised as the top airline in the Airline Industry Category at the 17th annual Ask Africa Orange Index awards ceremony. The awards are regarded as the broadest and most widely-referenced service excellence standard in South Africa and it covers more than 31 industries and 168 companies. The Head of Marketing for British Airways Shaun Pozyn said: "Winning this award for the third consecutive year is a wonderful accomplishment as it shows that our investment in excellent service is providing a great customer experience for all our travellers." He added that the award is a good indicator that our offering to business travellers meets their needs as well as the needs of travellers that fly with the airline for leisure. The award for the airline comes as the company counts down the months until they welcome a brand-new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in early 2019. According to British Airways, the aircraft has a modern, more environmentally friendly design and have added benefits for our business and leisure travellers. "We continually strive to provide the best services for those passengers who choose to travel with us and we will continue to do so by flying our customers to more destinations in Africa, whilst offering our signature British Airways hospitality onboard," concludes Pozyn. British Airways is operated by Comair. Follow the Business Report on Instagram here BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
