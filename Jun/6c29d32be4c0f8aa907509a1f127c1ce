Kolisi, the first black captain of the Boks, will lead a team in the first Test against England which features eight black players, including seven black African players. Bok coach Rassie Erasmus further named three more players of colour on his bench. The first Test against Eddie Jones’s England promises to be a thrilling encounter with the likes of rookie wings Aphiwe Dyantyi and S’bu Nkosi in the starting team and the side potentially having a black African front row in Trevor Nyakane, Bongi Mbonambi and Tendai Mtawarira. There is, however, some doubt over the fitness of the Bulls’ Nyakane, who is nursing a rib injury. Erasmus made it clear yesterday that he fully supports transforming the Springboks and will thus try a number of different combinations and players until the World Cup in Japan next year. The coach said he had three goals to tick as Bok boss, having taken over from Allister Coetzee at the beginning of the year. “We have to win, we want to fix transformation and want to build experience and squad depth,” explained Erasmus. “Winning is massively important and I’m going to have to make some brave calls,” added the new national rugby coach. “I don’t want to go into crisis mode and make conservative selections, go back to the old guys you trust. “We need to keep evolving, trying new guys, testing guys, putting them under pressure. "We must build leadership in the team, and hopefully win while doing that.” Erasmus and South Africa will be hoping Ellis Park - the place that united this country 23 years ago when then president Nelson Mandela handed Bok captain Francois Pienaar the William Webb Ellis trophy - is again good to Bok rugby and gives its new leader Kolisi a winning start as captain.
