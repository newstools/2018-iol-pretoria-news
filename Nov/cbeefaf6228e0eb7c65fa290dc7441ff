Yesterday, they visited the scene where the lives of Kearabile Baloyi, 12, Boitshoko Bobape, 11, Maikano Mmenu, 9, Lethabo Matibako, 9 and Dimpho Bopape, 5, were tragically taken away. Dimpho’s mother Dimakatso Bopape said the day brought mixed emotions, but she said she appreciated that the community cared for the affected families. Bopape said she missed her daughter every day as she was her only child. She said on the day of her daughter’s death, she shared her sphatlho (popular South African sandwich) with her friends. This was something she had never done before. Yesterday, the community put up five crosses and lit candles around the high-mast light. The day included visits by pastors to families to offer prayers and consolation. Councillor Phumzile Hlatswayo said: “Their passing is not in vain, but serves as a remembrance of our commitment to serve the community better and protect the future of South Africa, our children. “Today, we are not here to bury, but to remember that on this day a tragedy happened in our community.” Hlatswayo told those gathered that although families received counselling from social workers and psychologists, prayer was the only help that could completely heal the wounds. He encouraged members of the community to visit the scene every day to light the candles around the high-mast light. He also told them to attend the Saturday commemoration which would include a prayer service, a 5km walk dedicated to the children and petition of 10000 signatures calling for the removal of the killer high-mast light. There will also be a memorandum handed to police. The commemoration will end on November 17.
