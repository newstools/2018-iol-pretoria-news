Ntando, from Equestria, was named in the top 100 of the SA Teen 2018 Ambassador contest. Her journey began when she was invited along with the other teenagers from all over South Africa for the inaugural Shine Workshop at Faircity Quatermain Hotel in Sandton. The aspiring SA Teen Ambassador said the first time she saw information on the pageant on the internet, she felt confident she could take the crown. In her essay to convince the judges why she would be perfect to be part of the SA Teen 2018 Ambassador Top 100 semi-finalists, she said she wanted to be a role model to her peers to show them they could do anything they set their mind on. “At first glance when I looked at the post on the internet, I saw this pageant was not like any other; it is about charity work and what type of person you are that guarantee you a place. The organisers do not discriminate whether you are slim or big. You do not have to meet societal stereotypes of what a beautiful woman looks like. “I believe in myself and have the confidence to showcase my level of actually getting things done at the age of 15. I have mastered the art of not comparing myself to other girls; yes they are beautiful, but I have found my own inner beauty that shines through and I think the judges are looking for that.” SA Teen Ambassador is a new concept and empowerment programme for young women between the ages of 15 and 19 of all races. The programme celebrates teenagers who aspire to be the best version of themselves, inspire their peers and ultimately mould the youth who are the future of South Africa “I am humbled to be a Miss SA Teen Ambassador semi-finalist and I am committed to working hard for the organisation and setting a great example for the SA Teen Ambassador brand.’’ This Saturday, 25 lucky entrants will be selected for the finals. The winner will be announced in December. To vote for her, SMS Ntando Sgudla to 35959.
