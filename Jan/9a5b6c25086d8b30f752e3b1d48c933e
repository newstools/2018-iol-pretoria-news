Billiat hasn’t featured for Sundowns in a while now and it is a common knowledge that he wants to leave the club. His current deal expires in June. Loyilane has dismissed rumours suggesting Billiat has signed the pre-contact with Amakhosi. “Billiat is still a Mamelodi Sundowns player. Yes, according to Fifa rules, he can sign a pre-contract but hasn’t signed one. Chiefs have never contacted me regarding Billiat,” Loyilane stated. Billiat joined Sundowns in 2013 and has won all the major competitions during his time in with them. Billiat has won two Absa Premiership titles, the Nedbank Cup, Telkom Knockout, Caf Champions League and Caf Super Cup. “Billiat’s first preference is still going overseas,” Loyilane said. "He has won almost every trophy in South Africa. What is there to achieve for him here? We are hopefully that he will make his move to Europe before the transfer window closes." Billiat has been linked with teams in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and Sundowns have already planned for life without him by signing the likes of Aubrey Ngoma. Loyilane is due to meet with Sundowns officials this week to try and clarify the future of Billiat. “All the player wants is to play football,” Loyilane elaborated. Sundowns have also loaned Yannick Zakri to Ajax Cape Town, according to his agent Mike Maakab. - Minenhle Mkhize
