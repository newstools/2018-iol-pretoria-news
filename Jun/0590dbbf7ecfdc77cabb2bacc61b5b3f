Among the favourites is 19-year-old Travis Barrett who proved last year with his eighth-place finish in the Telkom 94.7 Cycle Challenge that he can be a rider for the big moment. What made the Tuks student’s performance remarkable is that he finished only 67 seconds behind Daryl Impey, the first South African rider to win the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. Maties dominated during last year’s Ussa with Gert Heyns the men’s overall winner while Frankie du Toit took the women’s title. The Tuks cycling team was second overall. Kevin Patten was the last Tuks rider to win overall in 2014 when he won three of the five stages. Tuks were also the overall champions in 2013. Another Tuks rider Edwill O’Neill says he and his teammates can reclaim the title this year. His confidence emanates from the performances of Barrett, Andries Nigrini and Alex Worsdale. Nigrini is the overall leader in the Student Mountain Cup series while Worsdale finished fifth in the first stage of the Tour de Limpopo. Apart from being the first Under-18 rider to finish in the 94.7 race, Barrett also won the 94.7’s 25km mountain bike race. The three-day event that will be held in and around the Voortrekker Monument consists of two road stages, an individual time trial, a hill climb time trial as well as a criterium. - African News Agency (ANA)
