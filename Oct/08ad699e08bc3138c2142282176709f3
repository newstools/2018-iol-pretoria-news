Tabane was first suspended by the station after using it as a platform to address a personal issue by apologising to Williams on matters related to her testimony. He was subsequently fired. Monday's article related to the ongoing GladAfrica tender scandal and circumstances surrounding Tshwane city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola, who last week successfully interdicted the tabling of an interim report on the matter to council. In the same article, it was stated that Tabane owned a PR company that convened a media briefing on behalf of Mosola. It has since emerged that the company was in fact owned by Lorato Tshenkeng. The Pretoria News duly apologise to both Tabane and Tshenkeng in this regard.
