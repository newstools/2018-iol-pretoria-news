The IAAF introduced a new policy which would attempt to regulate women that naturally produce testosterone levels above five nanomoles per litre. ASA threatened to take the IAAF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if it did not withdraw the amended regulations. “As a member federation, we will engage the IAAF as our mother body and if they do not change their minds on this new rule after this engagement, we will proceed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for further assistance on the matter,” ASA said in a statement. For now, the regulations are limited to athletes that compete in events ranging from the 400m to the 1500m. ASA said it had consulted widely with role-players which included the Minister of Sport, the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, various expert institutions and other relevant organisations and individuals on the matter. ASA is the second national athletics federation to call for a review of the new rules.  Athletics Canada has said it would hold discussions with government officials and other national sports organisations but believed the “IAAF eligibility ruling requires rigorous review”. However, the European Athletics Council has welcomed the new IAAF regulations.
