The facility was closed as a result of the accidental leakage of safety pepper spray in the pharmacy and was expected to reopen today. The City had undertaken work to remove and replace the ceiling as well as roof ridges where leakages were identified. MMC for Health Sakkie du Plooy said the facility would start operating on November 14 because more work still needed to be done. “On Monday, there was top management meeting. Communication will be issued to the public that the clinic will be opened on November 14." Du Plooy said last Thursday when he visited the clinic he got the impression that the contractor was working very hard. “They have done a thorough job. They have replaced all the ceilings and aircons. Behind the clinic there is construction for the extension of a pharmacy and consultation rooms,” he said. For the duration of the clinic's closure patients were urged to use Stanza Bopape clinic. Staff members claimed the unsafe condition made them develop chest pains, itching, headaches, sore throats and dizziness. Last year nurses and other workers complained to the SA Municipal Workers Union and the Occupational Health and Safety section of the municipality. They were worried the clinic didn't comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
