Last week, the City of Tshwane pleaded with residents to use water sparingly to avoid the drop of reservoir levels. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said Rand Water had tasked the metro with saving 20% of water used in order to manage reservoir levels. In response, the City, which gets the bulk of its supply from Rand Water, instructed residents to use water sparingly. On Monday, residents at Olievenhoutbosch were the first to experience the water cuts as predicted by the City and Rand Water. Mashigo said they had sent tankers to areas without water and were working with councillors in terms of distribution. “We still appeal to our residents to do their part to cut down on their water consumption. Conserving water will ensure that communities‘ taps do not run dry.” Rand Water spokesperson Justice Mohale said the restrictions were standard practice, especially during the warmer season. “Each year around this time, we restrict the flow of water within municipalities, especially now during the warmer season. “When it is hot, water consumption goes up, hence we control the water flow in order to avoid reservoirs running dry.” Mohale said it was better to reduce water consumption to avoid having the supply completely dry up. “If the reservoir runs completely dry, it would take time to raise and give water to municipalities, which could result in communities being without water; hence this precaution is important.” Pretoria North residents also experienced water interruptions on Tuesday, but this was due to a broken valve connected to the main supply network. The City warned residents in that area and those in the surrounding suburbs of the unplanned water interruptions and also stationed water tankers at Ninapark Spar, Pretoria North city hall and Jack Hindon Street Clinic.
