JAMES MAHLOKWANE YOUNG award winning poultry farmer Clement Pilusa, 29, hosted and motivated young entrepreneurs from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) at his Onderstepoort farm. At least 70 young business people in their 20s gathered at Pilusa Poultry Farms to interact with successful young farmers and agriculture role players, academics and bankers who explained their role in farming. Coming from nothing to trading at least 2000 chickens a week turned the former Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student into an inspiration. He shared the story of his journey with the youngsters who wished to one day influence the markets of their fields. The department of agriculture and rural development named Pilusa as the best young farmer for 2017 and 2018. In 2015, he won R600 000 from South African Breweriesâ€™ KickStart Entrepreneurship competition. All that money was invested back into the farm to put it where it is today. Despite his current success, Pilusa could not forget the challenges he faced when he started, and the challenges he continued to face. He said it was important for any farmer to remain focused and realise that there is no such thing as the perfect moment to start farming.
