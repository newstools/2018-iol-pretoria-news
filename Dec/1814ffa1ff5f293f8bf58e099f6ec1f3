On Saturday, they were showered with goodies and gifts by a group of good Samaritans from non-governmental organisations in Mamelodi. Themba Masango, secretary general of the #NotInMyName movement, said: “We've come out to give out Christmas packs to young girls in the spirit of 16 Days of Activism of No Violence against Women, Children and People living with Disabilities. “Most disadvantaged young girls in the townships come into the festive season not even having sanitary towels or deodorants,” he said. His organisation wanted to show young girls that they were valued and important. Social activist Matebogo Nkosi said: “It makes one feel good to be part of giving back. But it makes me sad that we have to give while our government is not doing anything to help.” Patience Malandula, chairperson of Zimele Investment Club, motivated young women: “Focus on education because it has helped some of us get out of poverty."
