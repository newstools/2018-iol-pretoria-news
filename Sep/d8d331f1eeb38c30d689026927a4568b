Jonah Munyi from AAA said he was impressed by the quality of the Pretoria entries, with some standing out for their wonderful concept and others as beautiful works of art. Asked what the judges were looking for, Pretoria News editor Val Bojé said a combination of a striking design and artistic flair, but also something that made the viewer think about the newspaper’s 120th birthday. Jacarandas, the Union Buildings and other landmarks including the Pretoria City Hall and Voortrekker Monument featured, as did the historic church in which the Pretoria News was started, and its founding editor Leo Weinthal. There were references to Nelson Mandela and the Women’s March, news highlights, time pieces and birthdays with cakes, candles and fireworks. Also judged were the junior categories. For now the results remain under lock and key - to be released once the special supplement has been completed. The winning Grade 11 work will grace the cover with the runner-up on the back cover, and the artists involved will be awarded certificates and prizes. Staff Reporter
