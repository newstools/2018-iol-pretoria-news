On Friday afternoon, there was a horrific accident on that stretch of road that claimed the lives of 27 people. I heard later that the driver of a truck carrying cement bags travelling towards Polokwane lost control after a tyre burst. He collided with a 22-seater bus a bakkie a luxury vehicle and an SUV. The taxi was crushed and two vehicles burst into flames. The N1 north is busy with cars, taxis, buses and trucks, sections are marked as “high accident zones”, and there are crosses in this section to show where people have lost their lives. I must admit this all preyed on my mind as we made the journey home on Sunday afternoon. On Saturday, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande directed the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) accident construction team working with provincial traffic teams and the police to investigate the accident and find the factors which could have caused it, including that the road narrows from Kranskop to Polokwane. While Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha visited survivors, his Transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje called on Sanral to prioritise the road, saying the fact that this was the third bad accident in such a short space of time indicated the need for national action. We need to see such action fast as we approach the busy holiday period. It could include an engineering solution such as a barrier between north- and south-bound traffic, more visible policing all along the route such as we saw on Sunday, random checks for roadworthiness of vehicles, speed trapping, and driver education.
