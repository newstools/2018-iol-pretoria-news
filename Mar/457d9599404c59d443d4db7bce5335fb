Kids will have a lot of fun with the planned Easter egg treasure hunt and an Amazing race lined up for the school break. The zoo is one of the city’s top tourist attractions and has been voted as one of the best spots for a picnic. And, with so much to see, one can make a family day of it, said spokesperson Angeline Schwan. The treasure hunt activity takes place throughout the long weekend, and the zoo will be giving away thousands of marshmallow eggs. “There will also be “Amazing Races” taking place, where teams of up to five can complete, gathering clues situated around the zoo as they attempt to complete the route in the quickest time,” she said. Winners of each round will be entered into a lucky draw, she said. Zoo mascots will be on hand giving out ice creams and spot prizes. While adults relax, children can participate in activities on offer. To publicise the activities the zoo invited the media for a photoshoot of three cute bunnies donated by a member of the public, and we got them to pose for this picture with Easter eggs. “Unfortunately, they will not be displayed to the public as they are still in their quarantine period,” Schwan said. However, she said, all other animals will be available for viewing.  The zoo is spread over 85 hectares and is the largest zoo of its kind in South Africa. Among the animals visitors can see are the critically endangered black rhino and mountain gorilla, and the endangered African penguin, Cape vulture and pygmy hippo, as well as the popular Big Five including elephant, lion and cheetah, and exotics such as the koala bear and kangaroo. Standard entrance fees apply: R110 for adults and R70 for children between the ages of 2 and 15. To see the video of the bunnies, download the free IOL app on your smart device.
