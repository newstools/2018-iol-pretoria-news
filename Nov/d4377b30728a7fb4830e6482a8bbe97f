THE Department of Health spokesperson Popo Maja said the deputy-director who fainted in the controversial building was living with a chronic illness. This came at the Public Servants Association (PSA) blamed her collapse on the poor quality of the air in the building that has been boycotted by staff and several unions. Numerous employees have not been reporting for duty since last week after an inspector from the office of the inspector general hit the department with a prohibition notice. This is despite the department successfully appealing the prohibition notice on the basis of the procedure followed to issue the notice. The department convinced the inspector-general's office to allow the use of safe floors and areas to be used for business. “I can say with certainty that the colleague did not faint because of the quality of the air and I have checked with the security manager, there is no confirmation of increased number of instances of staff being taken from the building to hospital by an ambulance,” said Maja. PSA chairperson at the Department of Health, Peter Moloi, said they believed the official fainted in the building after breathing in a bad smell in the parking area. However, Maja said the claim was not true because he also parked on the same level and there was no bad smell. “I am not an expert but I also believe that that parking area should have a better quality of air than most areas in the building because it is much more open, he said.”
