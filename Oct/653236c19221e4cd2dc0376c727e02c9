Pretoria - The Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge (FAK) unveiled a new bust at Paul Kruger’s grave in Heroes' Acre following acts of vandalism. The grave was vandalised in July this year, prompting FAK to seek help for urgent repairs of the grave so it could be restored to its place in the City’s heritage and history. Centurion sculpture Jacques Muller saw the damage done to the grave on social media and offered his skills to restore the bust and also carve a new one for free. Editor of DEKAT magazine Elzilda Becker agreed to cover the costs of repairing the gravestone, which was vandalised back in 1995. Muller said: “When I saw on social media that the guys vandalised the sculpture, I thought maybe they were opportunistic and thought it was a bronze sculpture and wanted to sell it for metal value. “I thought this is such a lovely cemetery with so much of the country’s history and that’s why I thought it was a good initiative for me as a sculpture who works in stone to create a bust for the next generation to come and appreciate.” Muller said he used granite because it was strong and unbreakable, and also because that was metaphorical for Kruger’s character. The grave has been vandalised numerous times since the 1990s by various culprits who seem to get away with it. This time, FAK visited the grave on July 18 to confirm social media posts that it was indeed vandalised again. The organisation sought the assistance of the City to preserve this new bust and the cemetery. The City said it is willing to assist. Pretoria News
