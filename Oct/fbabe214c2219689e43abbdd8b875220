With the sold-out signs having long gone up, the desperate are making last-minute calls in an effort to secure tickets for what promises to be a humdinger. Some might get lucky, but host club Orlando Pirates have warned ticketless soccer fans to avoid making their way to the FNB Stadium and rather watch the spectacle unfold on television. The Buccaneers host arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs inside the world-famous Calabash with both sides sitting pretty high up on the league table and looking to make this their turnaround season following long trophyless spells. It is due to the renewed vigour and great form of both the country’s traditionally biggest and best clubs that the excitement for this season’s derby is at fever pitch and the 82000 tickets were snapped up as soon as they went on sale. Ahead of tomorrow’s match, the usual clarion call remains - make your way to the FNB stadium as early as possible to avoid the hectic traffic. Strict traffic control measures by the JMPD will be in operation around the stadium from 8am. There will be road closures around the stadium precinct and the public is warned against parking in non-designated areas as they risk having their cars towed away. Motorists are advised not to follow the direction of illegal car guards to illegal parking areas. Better still, use public transport such as the Rea Vaya buses, Uber, Top 6 and other taxi services specifically laid out for the derby. In order to avoid any mishaps, security at the stadium will be tight so that one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles remains just that - a carnival atmosphere of great football. See Sport
