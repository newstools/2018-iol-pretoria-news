If you think you have an idea that can help South Africa take the next step forward within the information technological sector the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) is looking for you. SITA in partnership with the Presidency, today officially launched the #NDP2030Hackathon, calling on government officials, state-owned companies, private corporations, members of non-profit organisations, students and all citizens over the age of 18. All in the name of helping the country meet its National Development Plan (NDP) for 2030, and harness the power of information technology to benefit the nation as a whole. Ideas that will ultimately help the country to solve socio-economic challenges standing in the way of the country reaching its full potential. Deputy Minister for the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, said she was confident that initiatives like these would help the country move at a faster pace to meet the NDP goals. Ndabeni-Abrahams said, as government did not assume it knew it all the Hackathon was one way of reaching out to South Africans who perhaps had "nuggets of gold" that could be of great use. “As government we may not have the funding but there will be people out there who want to help their country, and help to be able to deliver the best services to our people working together,” she added. The Hackathon has three categories for people to part take in mainly, code jam, data science and the internet of things. Winners with the brightest ideas stand a chance of winning a cash prize in each category of R100 000. Second place will be awarded R50 000 and third place will walk away with R30 000.
