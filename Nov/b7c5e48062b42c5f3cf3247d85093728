This has made it nearly impossible for her to leave or re-enter the country. Amy Myburgh, of Pretoria, stated in court papers that she was flagged by mistake on the department’s system as being “an undesirable foreigner”. Every time she wanted to leave or enter the country, officials detained her and questioned her at length. She tried to avoid travelling before the issue was resolved, but now did not have a choice, because her mother was diagnosed with possible cancer. She asked the court to force the department to decide on an appeal she had lodged against the officials' “incorrect” decision to refuse her a temporary visa to live with her husband in South Africa, resulting from her status as “undesirable”. She said it would also be near impossible for her to re-enter South Africa if she travelled. She and her husband married in 2006 and lived in England. They moved to South Africa in 2010 when she received a temporary spousal permit. When she later renewed her permit, she was given an “immediate relative” permit, although she was a spouse. Myburgh appealed against this decision in 2014 but was still awaited the outcome. She said she had to leave the country at the time to attend her best friend’s wedding, and was put through an ordeal to exit and enter the country. Myburgh stated that errors were escalating and because she was blacklisted by mistake, her permit was in turn rejected. The department, she said, confirmed by email to her that they had removed her name from the blacklisting, as it was their mistake. But as things stand, it was not yet removed. Home Affairs did not file any opposing papers in this application. Judge Cynthia Pretorius ordered the department to decide on Myburgh’s appeal within seven days in a bid to set things right.
