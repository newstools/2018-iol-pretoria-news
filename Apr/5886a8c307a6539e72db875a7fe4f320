JAMES MAHLOKWANE Previously disadvantaged Soshanguve Block TT residents were proud to see construction resume to complete their RDP houses after they were abandoned last year in March. Elderly beneficiary Elizabeth Ramponi, 78, was all smiles yesterday at the sight of construction workers who worked on the roof of the RDP house she had been waiting for since 1994. Ramponi and Mokgadi Kekana, 96, were unhappy after they were rained on heavily in their small shacks on March 23 when heavy rains caused flood chaos in Tshwane. They were disappointed because they had removed their shacks from the centre of their yards to make space for RDP houses that remained without roof tiles, doors, ceilings, taps, baths and windows for over 12 months. Ramponi said: “I am so happy right now I don't even know how to thank you guys from Pretoria News for bringing our plight to their attention. I waited from 1994 for this house and that makes this moment very special. I have spent the rest of my life living in a shack so I am happy I will finally live in a house built with bricks that has a ceiling and a tiled roof,” Ward councillor Maria Skhosana said the problem was caused by complications with the use of subcontractors and a demarcation process that moved the beneficiaries to another ward. She said beneficiaries could rest assured that all incomplete RDP houses in the area would be completed by June this year.
