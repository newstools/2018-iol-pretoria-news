The Nelson Mandela Foundation has sought ways to assist and one is through the launch of an official T-shirt adorned with 240 words associated with his vision. “Nelson Mandela was well known for attaching significance to what he wore,” said foundation chief executive Sello Hatang at the launch of the T-shirt, which was hosted by the foundation and its partner, manufacturer Trade Call Investments Apparel (TCI). The target is to sell 1million T-shirts across the globe. “Every word carries a value. It is a word you can take with you (through life),” said Hatang. The 240 words on the T-shirt form an illustration of the former president's smiling face. Hatang urged people who buy the T-shirt to wear it on Mandela Day and on “Mandela Fridays”, which is a campaign to focus the attention of South Africans on deepening our democracy and realising the dreams of Madiba. “We want you to wear the T-shirt with a sense of pride in Mandela’s legacy. We want you to pass on a message of a resilient nation, a caring nation,” said Hatang. He stressed that proceeds from sales would go to helping the foundation continue Madiba’s work. TCI chief executive Herman Pillay said he hoped that involvement in honouring Mandela’s legacy would go beyond wearing the T-shirt. “Mandela walked and lived with purpose,” said Pillay. “Who better to take on his legacy than the next generation?” - Staff Reporter
