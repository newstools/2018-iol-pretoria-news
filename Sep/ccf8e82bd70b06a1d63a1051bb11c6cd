The new CHOC-Childhood Cancer Foundation house is abuzz as they officially open the new home in Lyttelton, Pretoria today. Setting the mood for the handover by Clover to CHOC house was the Heron Bridge High School with their melodious voices. Initially, the CHOC House was based in Capital Park but due to space constraints at the three-bedroom home they moved to the new house on Mandela Day this year, leaving the old house which accommodated six children and six caregivers for many years. The newer house has six bedrooms, is bigger and accommodates eight children with their eight caregivers. Among the bedrooms is an en-suite bedroom for children undergoing bone marrow transplants. The handover saw attendance by media influencers such as the country’s model, actress and media socialite, Gail Mabalane, presenter Thembisa Mdoda, LeAnne Dlamini and Mapaseka Mokwele. Marcelo Palmeiro of Clover said they decided to partner with CHOC years ago in order to make a difference in the society.

The fact that I love children also made it easy to be part of this project,” he said. Palmeiro told those gathered that this was the sixth CHOC house opened Clover. Actress, breast cancer survivor and activists, Lillian Dube shared a bit of her story with those at the ceremony and told them that early cancer detection and treatment saves lives. She further praised Steve Biko Academic Hospital doctors in the oncology ward for their dedication.
