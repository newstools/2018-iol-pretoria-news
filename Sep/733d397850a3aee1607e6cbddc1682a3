It has been almost 18 hours since Uzalo’s Monday night episode aired but Twitter is still abuzz. MaNgcobo (real name Dawn King) gate-crashed her husband's wedding to MaMlambo ( real name Gugu Gumede) and pulled a gun on the bride. Over the past season producers have been building up the love triangle between Nkunzi, MaNgcobo and MaMlambo, the onetime friends who are now rivals for Nkunzi's affections. The thought of having her best friend also marrying her husband did not at all sit well with MaNgocbo so she did something about it. “Nishada kanjani uMakoti engekho (is there ever a wedding without the bride?)”. MaNgcobo uttered the words after firing a few shot in the air-dressed in her white gown. The venue of where the wedding was taking place was hidden from her but she managed to find it anyway and caused a scene. The episode concluded with MaNgcobo asking her husband who he wanted to wed, with the gun still pointed at the other bride. While other people took to social media to  create humour about the dramatic scene, others praised the actress for “nailing” her role. The wedding day drama continues again tonight and viewers can’t wait. Here are some of the reactions following the episode:  How can there be a wedding without a bride mara!! #Uzalowedding https://t.co/85qKRO8g0H  — Martins Molele (@molele_martins)

 September 24, 2018   I never supported MaNgcobo's behavior towards this love triangle. She's too desperate for a man. Shiya inja, pick yourself up, fix your crown & walk away with pride & dignity. #uzalo #uzalowedding #wedding pic.twitter.com/SGop2vzuEN  — Amile 🌹 (@Uplifted_one)
