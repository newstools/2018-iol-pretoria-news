This year’s annual event was held under the theme “Rag of Hope” and was held at Tuks Rag Stadium. While some set up stalls and sold their products, others spent the day playing games. The games included diketo, where the challenge was to scoop up the allocated number of stones. The game requires good eye-hand co-ordination. Kgati, which requires the first player to skip the rope and perform all sorts of tricks while other members try to imitate him or her, was also featured. Annelize Morgan, a third-year education student, told the Pretoria News that she was having a good time. “I love the Rag fiesta for the games - this is where we take things back to our childhood and play all the games we used to before we all thought we had grown up and knew better. “Right now we are letting our inner child come out to play and it is great to see everyone having so much fun,” she said. Tuks Rag is a student non-profit charity organisation with a strong tradition of public service and charitable contribution. The event encourages students to join in the fun of serving and educating the larger community.
