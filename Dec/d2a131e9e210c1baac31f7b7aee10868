Bronkhorstspruit - There was tension at the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court today before Congolese prophet William Emeka appeared for allegedly raping and sexual assaulting church members. Police had to intervene and escort out a male foreign national who clashed with EFF members and residents who protested against the prophet before court proceedings commenced. Emeka, through his council, abandoned his bail application without giving reasons as his rights allowed him to do. The controversial “Man of God” has been in police custody this month since seven women opened cases of rape and sexual assault against him, sparking tension between community members. Community members who joined forces with the local EFF leadership have been exchanging insults in and outside court with those supporting Emeka. The National Prosecuting Authority had deployed “top-dog” advocate Hanna Conradie, who prosecutes big cases of national interest, to oppose Emeka’s bail application. However, Emeka’s council announced that it was instructed by the prophet to abandoned the application. Magistrate David Shikwambane said: “The accused has decided to abandon his bail application at the moment. I don’t need to know the reasons. It’s his constitutional right. "He can still bring in a bail application later because that’s his right.” EFF ward 105 chairperson Tebogo Mohlamonyane said fighters were happy that the prophet would remain in police custody for the festive season.
