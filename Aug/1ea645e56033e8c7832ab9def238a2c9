The Grafinger Youth Orchestra, or Grafinger Jugendorchester (GJO), is made up of 60 musicians between the ages of 13 and 26, and it performs a wide range of music - including classical, jazz, rock and pop, as well as modern Bavarian music. While in the country they will perform with the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra at the Wits Great Hall on Sunday, September 2, and concertgoers can look forward to classic pieces such as Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin, Air on a G String by Johann Sebastian Bach and You Raise Me Up by Rolf Lovland. The orchestra will also perform its interpretation of Dream on by Aerosmith and an orchestrated swing version of No Good in heavy rock by Kaleo, as well as some film music from the movie, Beverly Hills Cop. Music lovers in Pretoria can enjoy a varied programme including Bavarian music when the GJO performs at the German International School on Tuesday, September 4, at 7pm. Hedwig Gruber, director and conductor of the Grafinger Youth Orchestra, said coming to South Africa was an excellent opportunity for their young musicians and allowed them to share German culture with South Africans. They look forward to performing and to an exchange of experiences with young African musicians. In addition to the two concerts, the orchestra will perform at the Eyethu Music School, Soweto, and at Nelson Mandela Square, Sandton, on September 1, and with musicians in Hammanskraal on September 5 and 6. The tour was made possible by the state of Bavaria, Germany, the German Business Community and German and South African Rotary Clubs. Tickets are available from Computicket at R125 for the Joburg concert and Nuticket for the Pretoria show. -Staff Reporter
