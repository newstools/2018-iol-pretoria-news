Pretoria - The Gauteng Provincial Legislature’s Roads and Transport Committee has taken the decision to intervene in the "deadlock" between Gautrain operator Bombela and trade union, United National Transport Union (Untu). The decision was taken by the committee as the strike by Untu members entered its 12th day, with no resolution in sight. This is after repeated attempts by both parties to hold meetings to resolve the salary deadlock, and failure by the CCMA to find a resolution for a second time on Wednesday. The committee announced following the CCMA’s unsuccessful attempts that they were “deeply concerned” about the impasse which was negatively affecting commuters who relied heavily on the Gautrain to get to work. As such the committee has seemingly called for an urgent meeting between Transport MEC Ishmael Vadi and the Gautrain CEO, Jack van der Merwe in the coming days to find ways of addressing this urgent and critical matter. The Gautrain’s available services over the weekend: Weekend service (11 August – 12 August): Over the upcoming weekend, the following reduced service will apply: OR Tambo – Sandton Stations (East-West bound): A train service will be available every 36 minutes between OR Tambo and Sandton Station, not stopping at Rhodesfield from 05h45 to 21h00. Pretoria – Park Stations (North-South bound): Trains will not operate between Pretoria and Park Stations. A bus service will be available to transport passengers between Pretoria and Sandton (every 60 minutes), and between Sandton and Park Stations (every 30 minutes).
