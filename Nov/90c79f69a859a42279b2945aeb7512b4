Pretoria - The two third majority victory registered by the ANC in Tshwane during the ward nine by-election in Winterveldt on Wednesday demonstrated that people strongly rejected the DA-led administration. This was according to the regional party chairman Dr Kgosi Maepa, who took to social media to celebrate the ANC's 68% win. The DAÂ  scored 17%, while the EFF, which had hoped to take over the ward, only scored 10% at the ballots. The new ward councillor Barbara Baloyi would succeed the former ANC councillor Sipho Maselane, who was expelled from the party after he was convicted of rape at the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrate's Court in July. Maepa said: "Voters and residents of Tshwane are strongly rejecting the corrupt DA-led administration and their partners ACDP, Cope, EFF and FF+." He ridiculed the DA for being "hypocritical", claiming the party fared dismally despite distributing food parcels, goodies and blankets to the electorates. Maepa said the strategy by the DA to deploy its big guns in Tshwane also failed to yield them favourable results. "Our branches and volunteers are regaining lost ground and reclaiming back the City of Tshwane, one branch at a time. We are focused and determined. It is the second successive and comprehensive victory in Tshwane's by-elections for the ANC," he said. DA ward candidate Peter Themba rebuffed the claim that his party used donations as a bait to lure voters. "It is pure lie. We campaigned clean and we never even had T-shirts to give out," he said. He said the true reflection of the results was that the DA dramatically grew its support in the area by 12%. According to him, the ANC was the biggest loser after its support declined from 83% it achieved during the 2016 municipal polls. "The DA won in terms of growing their percentage. I am not even disappointed with the results," he said.
