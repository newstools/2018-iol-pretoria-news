Following the incident, crowdfunding platform BackaBuddy launched an appeal to the public to assist the family to pay for her therapy sessions. The campaign was established by concerned citizens who wanted to remain anonymous. It was revealed that one of the donors contributed the amount of R31 018.97. BackaBuddy’s Catherine du Plooy said the family were still trying to come to terms with the shock. “In what has been a very trying time, the family wish to extend their sincere gratitude to the campaign creator - the BackaBuddy team - and the 193 donors who have generously supported this cause through donations and messages of support,” she said. Du Plooy further mentioned that the campaign was continuing and that donations would be used to help rebuild the little girl’s life and cover the needs of the family during this difficult time. “All funds raised with this initiative will be strictly managed by BackaBuddy. Funds will only be released to the family directly or to relevant practitioners identified by the family to help cover any needs she might have.” When pleading for donations, the group said: “We know that rape can traumatise the victim emotionally for years afterwards; so we hope the funds raised will be used for therapy and rehabilitation for the victim so that she can have some semblance of normality or even happiness again... “We are also happy for the family to use these funds in any way they see fit - we trust the family will know best what to do to help their daughter under the circumstances.” A 21-year-old man arrested in connection with the rape is in custody and has already appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. He will return to the same court on November 1.
