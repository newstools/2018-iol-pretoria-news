Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesperson Simon Zwane said the online system for learners, driving licence tests and renewal of driving licence cards in the province had shown a steady increase since its launch. To date, Zwane said 2259 people from 35 driving licence testing centres had used the system. He said walk-in services were still being available for renewal of driving licence cards and public driving permits, between 8am and 10am daily. Thereafter, appointments must be strictly made online. Apart from a few minor glitches, those who spoke to the Pretoria News said the system had made things easier, faster and more convenient. IIze de Lange used the system to renew her licence and said she was extremely impressed. De Lange said she had her purse stolen with her licence inside. She tried the online system and waited just a month to get an appointment date. On the day of the test, a power outage delayed proceedings, but she said she managed to get everything sorted. â€œIt costs a bit more to get a temporary licence but I would highly recommend the system. Anneke Hanekom, another user who gave the system the green light, said it worked great and had an SMS reminder on her appointment day. Minister of Transport Dr Blade Nzimande and Gauteng MEC for Transport and Roads Dr Ismail Vadi launched the service on August 30. They said they hoped it would modernise services and reduce opportunities for corruption. Four services can be accessed through the online service: 1. These are the booking of learner licence tests, driving licence tests, renewal of driving licence cards and public driving permits. 2. The service is available online at - natis.gov.za. 3. Walk-in bookings are still open, but will be phased out in due course. 4. Motorists are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the new system.
