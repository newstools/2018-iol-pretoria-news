THE court case of Petrus “The General” Ndaba was once again postponed in the Specialised Commercial Crimes (SCC) Court in Pretoria this morning. Ndaba (55) appeared briefly in the SCC court for charges of kidnapping, assault, fraud and crimen injuria. This for allegedly luring and defrauding 259 youngsters, in a jobs-for-money scam at the SANDF. The scam came to light when the jobseekers, aged between 18 and 30, were seen on the streets of the Akasia suburb Karen Park. They had bags, blankets and other belongings on the street after they had allegedly been evicted from a house in the suburb because of unpaid rent. The victims were recruited mostly from KwaZulu-Natal and had reportedly paid R300 to R800 for registration, R1 800 for training, and R200 a month since 2016. Ndaba is alleged to have demanded payment for lodging from them as well. And according to the youngsters promised them a salary of R13 000 a month and said they would be given the opportunity to study further. The men and women shared a three-bedroomed house with one bathroom and used two wendy houses, with males and females sleeping together. Some slept in the kitchen, passages, dining room and lounge. They were subsequently taken to the Salvation Army for protection. In previous court appearances Ndaba was denied bail in the Pretoria Magistrate's court on July 10 2017 to await his trial date at the Kgosi-Mampuru II Correctional facility. Ndada will re-appear in the SCC court on November 30, as the matter was postponed for disclosure.
