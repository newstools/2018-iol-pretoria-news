In a bid to join the quick and more convenient online sphere - applying for job opportunities within the public service has officially gone paperless. Minister for Public Service and Administration, Ayanda Dlodlo, announced the launch of the e-Recruitment system in Pretoria. Dlodlo said the decision to take job applications within government departments online was part of the government's process to make it simpler and easier for people to apply for jobs. This was particularly taking into consideration the youth who literally lived and breathed on social platforms. Not only that but Dlodlo said the process would also allow for the review of regulations for all entry level posts and allow for the recruitment of new entrants particularly those without prior experience. “Our government is committed to addressing the challenge of high rates of youth unemployment in the country and to this end - we believe that the e-Recruitment system will alleviate the burden on our youth when applying for jobs in the Public Service.” “The e-Recruitment system is a beginning of a process to introduce a paperless administration across the public service.” However those with limited and no access to the internet, need not worry as Dlodlo said physical Z83 would still be accepted. She said going online was something that had been long overdue within government departments.
