In May, the SAPS embarked on a recruitment drive across the country, for the 2018/19 Basic Police Learning Development Programme intake for trainees to be placed across South Africa's 1146 police stations. It said qualifying candidates, who conformed to the basic enlistment requirements, would be subjected to thorough screening processes to determine their eligibility to serve as men and women in blue. At least 63000 applicants have undergone psychometric testing and those who pass will undergo physical fitness assessments and a medical examination. Deputy national commissioner for human resources management in the SAPS, Lieutenant-General Bonang Mgwenya said successful candidates would be notified, in writing and telephonically, by December 1. “The high number of applications received it is encouraging for us to know that young people are ready to fight against crime,” Mgwenya said. “These young people will be seen as force multipliers and will assist greatly in the fight against crime.” Applicants, who have not received any official communique from the service within three months from the closing date on June 15, should consider their application unsuccessful. - African News Agency (ANA)
