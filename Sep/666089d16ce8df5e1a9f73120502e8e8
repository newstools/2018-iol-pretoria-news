Spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said Rand Water was planning a shutdown of the Hartebeeshoek reservoir which caters for most areas north of Pretoria from Wednesday until Thursday morning. Mashigo said the shutdown was necessary for emergency repairs to be conducted on a 1500mm of damaged diameter isolating valve at the reservoir. He said all reservoirs supplied by the Hartebeeshoek reservoir would be filled to capacity to ensure provision of water to residents during the shutdown period. “We are cautioning residents to use water sparingly to avoid a rapid drop in water levels in the reservoir in order to avoid a situation that would lead to an interruption of services.” Ga-Rankuwa, Ga-Rankuwa Industrial, Mabopane, Winterveld, Soshanguve, New Eersterust and Rosslyn are some of the areas that might end up being affected should an interruption occur. “The City of Tshwane sincerely apologises for the inconvenience that may be encountered as a result of this emergency repair work. “We also appeal to all the residents to utilise water sparingly at all times.” The DA’s Janho Engelbrecht previously said issues such as potholes, power interruptions and water leaks could be attributed to the city’s old infrastructure.
