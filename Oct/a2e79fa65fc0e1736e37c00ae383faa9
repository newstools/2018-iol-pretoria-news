He was killed by apartheid state security forces at the John Vorster Square police station in Johannesburg, a week before his 30th birthday. “The lies that had been spread over the decades by former apartheid operatives that he committed suicide by jumping off the 10th floor window of John Vorster Square police station were exposed last year during the High Court inquest into Comrade Timol’s death. The truth was finally laid bare that Comrade Timol was brutally tortured by the police and then thrown out through the 10th floor window,” said national spokesperson Alex Mohubetswane Mashilo. The SACP, at its 14th national congress in 2017, conferred, posthumously, a Special Recognition Award on Timol. This was for his contribution to the Struggle against apartheid, for the social emancipation of all humanity, and for socialism. In 2009 the South African government conferred the National Order of Luthuli on him. “His was a just cause, one which should be recognised by the entire working class,” the SACP said.
