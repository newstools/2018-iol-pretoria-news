The densely populated settlement had been a thorn in the flesh for the former ANC administration. However, the ANC and its former mayors Gwen and Kgosientso “Sputla” Ramokgopa came and left but nothing changed at Plastic View. In all that time, talks about the imminent relocation of the residents grew louder whenever there was a fire disaster. But two Ramokgopas and a Msimanga later, nothing has come out of the talks. After another fire at the weekend, the next few days will be dominated by statements on how much everyone cares for Plastic View dwellers. It is time for action. The talk of how populated Plastic View is and the need for an audit to establish how many people there qualify for housing is stale and exhausted. Look out for our special coverage on this impoverished community on the front page. Another notable in this edition is the ANC's ongoing attempt to unseat Msimanga. This time, it wants the court to rule on a secret ballot to decide its motion of confidence against the mayor, who the ANC - under new chairperson Dr Kgosi Maepa - is desperate to dethrone. We also report on the latest parole bid by wife killer Omar Sabadia. We hope you enjoy this bumper edition.
