Pretoria - Visitors had to be turned away on Wednesday morning at Freedom Park, after a bomb scare. Vehicles that wanted to enter the premises were parked outside from about 9am. Only staff members, on foot, were allowed in. A security guard at the gate told the Pretoria News that they were under strict instructions not to let any vehicle, except for police vehicles inside the premises. According to Freedom Park’s CEO, Jane Mufamadi they received three calls from a guy, threatening that he had planted multiple bombs inside the premises. She said people including visitors and staff members had to be evacuated. “Luckily we know our fire and bomb drills,” she said. But despite the drills, Mufamadi said the majority of people were terrified and even started to panic. “I had to clam them down myself and give them counseling,” she said. The ordeal lasted for about two hours before the staff could go back to work. Mufamadi said this was the first incident since the inception of the park. “We cannot take chances with people lives. When we get a bomb scare we react. We can’t just take it lightly,” she said. The bomb scare comes just hours before a pro-Israeli group was set to march to the Union Buildings, after they were refused permission to pray there today. After a while, numerous police vehicles were seen leaving the premises, while residents looked on. Mufamadi said it was clear and back to business. Pretoria News
