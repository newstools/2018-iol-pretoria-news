The first step should involve the cleaning of one of Gauteng’s biggest and most polluted rivers - the Hennops River. It is with that task in mind that the Hennops Blue Horizon non-profit organisation held a three-day art exhibition fundraising event in Irene at the weekend. Katherine Fillmore, one of three directors of Hennops Blue Horizon, said the organisation had been established to raise awareness to heal the river which was in a crisis as it had for years been severely polluted with solid waste flowing downstream from urban areas and even raw sewage. David Cochrane, founder and director of the non-profit organisation, said the river had been degrading for the past 50 years as a result of urbanisation as well as sewerage systems and waste management which were under immense pressure. Cochrane said every time the sewerage systems became over-used sewage ended up flowing into the river. He said the situation was further aggravated by people not throwing away their litter properly which was washed into the river. Summer rains only made things worse, Cochrane said, as the rains brought down more litter into the river. “So efforts to pick it up afterwards are not helping as the problem needs to be addressed at the source.” Fillmore said that as an artist she had managed to convince her friends to paint and donate some of the proceeds to the organisation. “We asked local artists to paint work and they will donate a third of the profits to the organisation, with others donating 100% of the proceeds. “We need to have a united and powerful voice, and departments such as Water and Sanitation and Environmental Affairs should take this problem seriously and act decisively.”
