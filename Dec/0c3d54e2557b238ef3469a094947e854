She is a professional dancer, actress, singer and student, and an advocate for women’s empowerment on top of that. In one of her latest outstanding commitments, Blulyt can be seen performing a high-octane dance in the song Lengoma, a collaboration with singer Master KG. That video is due for release in April and will follow her appearance in the video of the song Bona, scheduled for release this month in which she appears with Chilli Bite, a Pretoria-based dance group of which she is part. The first-year TUT drama student believes it’s high time we rip apart our script for fighting gender-based violence and start afresh as current approaches have failed women. She spoke of the 16 Days of No Violence Against Women, and said gender violence summits such as the one held in Centurion a few weeks ago, where women victims of male aggression poured their hearts out to President Cyril Ramaphosa, were a good first step. There was a need for support for more such gender violence awareness initiatives. She is convinced that if women are more broadly empowered, they can leverage their status of emerging equality as a bulwark against the patriarchy that victimises them. Rising levels of representivity in society, including a higher ratio of women to male students at universities, was a good sign that more women were stepping out and shaping their own destinies, she added. She is also a fan of the axiom Wathinta umfazi wathint imbokodo (you strike a woman you strike a rock) and believes that only through collective advocacy will women begin to register successes and overturn the powerlessness that leaves them vulnerable. She also encourages women to work harder to advance their cause and she lives it. This year alone, in addition to numerous collaborations, she’s appeared in three dramas and also joined forces with Zanda Zakuza on a musical project. This is on top of working three days a week as a dancer at a Rosebank club and attending drama classes at TUT. Blulyt is inspired by her mother Lopane, who raised her and two older siblings single-handedly following the premature death of her father.
