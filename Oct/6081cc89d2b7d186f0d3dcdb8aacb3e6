The rumblings over the VBS report are far from over, and while some of those fingered in the R1.89bn looting spree are shouting their innocence, others will this week have to account to their political bosses. A high-profile team from the Hawks and NPA confirmed that they are already working on the case, with arrests imminent. We seldom report on other media, but do commend Sunday Times editor Bongani Siqoko, who has admitted the newspaper got three stories wrong. They will return awards received by their journalists in this regard. Both Nene and editor Siqoko have set an example of the moral high ground to the rest of us: when last did you hear a politician a) admit he was wrong and b) take the fall for his mistakes? The media too need to reflect constantly and uphold the highest ethics in reporting. With the Nugent Commission resuming this week and Zondo in November, we can expect to see many more remarkable weeks ahead.
