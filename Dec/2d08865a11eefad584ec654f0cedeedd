Cele told the media yesterday that despite the arrest of six people, the police were on the hunt for more suspects. Cele denied that the police were not visible near the Sasol garage, just outside the FNB Stadium, when the attacks took place. He said 50 cases of robbery were reported at various police stations, but the investigation into the incident would continue. The police have come under fire on social media for failing to rein in the criminals who went on a crime spree at the nearby Sasol garage. The victims said there were no police near the scene. Cele said he was not pointing fingers at anyone, but said the incidents may have happened because of a lack of prompt action from the police. The minister also blamed the traffic congestion outside the stadium when people were trying to leave. There was also a poor cellphone signal that led to people to go to the garage to get transport. “Indeed, SAPS is the main stakeholder as far as the prevention of crime is concerned. We concede that the inadequacy and the lack of prompt response of the police may have exacerbated the situation and presented an opportunity for criminal activities.”
