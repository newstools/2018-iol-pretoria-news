Cansa said the figure did not represent the full impact of those affected as at least half the number of children with cancer in the country go undiagnosed. To commemorate the month everyone is urged to wear a gold ribbon. Research has shown that the overall survival rate for childhood cancer in the country remains low compared to the international rate, with the South African Medical Journal saying a greater awareness of the warning signs was important to encourage earlier diagnosis. “While South Africa has an established oncology healthcare service, the infrastructure is overburdened, the cancer awareness in the primary healthcare service is poor and widespread service delivery challenges exist,” the journal said. Choc Childhood Cancer Foundation regional manager Ina Schomper said the country had to diagnose 2500 children each year, but instead the figure was just over 900, which meant about 1500 children died due to missed diagnosis. They called on everyone to stand up and fight for the treatment and ultimate possible survival of children with cancer, saying everyone could do their bit in whichever way they could.
