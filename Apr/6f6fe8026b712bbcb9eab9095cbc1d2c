Friday marks the liberation of the country and its people, the day on which the country celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post-apartheid elections held on April 27, 1994. Music lovers are invited to a soulful night with American music master, Kenny Lattimore, with his timeless, classic music. Remember his hit songs All My Tomorrows, For You and Love Me Back? Well you’ll be sure to hear those all-time favourites as Lattimore promised to sing them all. He pleaded with the public to buy tickets and support the show, saying: “South Africa, I’m coming to see you. I am coming to sing all my hits - For You, All My Tomorrows and new songs from my new album, Vulnerable. So please come and see me, get your tickets now.” With a reputation for being one of the world’s premier male vocalists and as a compelling songwriter who passionately explores universal truths, Lattimore’s music is known to speak straight to the heart about love and life. The music extravaganza will also mark Lattimore’s 30 years in music and promises guests a spectacular soulful night. Lattimore will share the stage with the country’s own multi-award winning stars, songstress Lerato Molapo better known as Lira and the magical trio, Mi Casa. Organisers said it was obvious that Lattimore would get the stage in flames. But the Feel Good hit-maker Lira and music trio - Mi Casa will certainly add to those flames with their most loved hit songs. Tickets are available from Computicket, Shoprite and Checkers and the prices range from: R190 (for early bird tickets), R290, R490, R590, R690, R850, R950, VIP R1350 and VVIP R1650.
