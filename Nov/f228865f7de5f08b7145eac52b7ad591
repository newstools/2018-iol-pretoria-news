Pretoria - Advocate Gerrie Nel head of AfriForum's private prosecution unit, will be supporting the Jimmy family against Ford Motor Company after Reshall Jimmy burnt to death in December 2015. “The criminal justice system of South Africa failed the victim in this case. "The family has been waiting for almost three years for the case to be investigated and AfriForum wrote letters imploring the Magistrate’s Court in George to hold a formal inquest,” Nel said. Nel announced this at their offices in Centurion during a press briefing. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decided not to prosecute Ford and denied the family a nolle prosequi (will no longer prosecute) certificate because they were awaiting the results of the inquest.

Jimmy burnt to death while on holiday in the Wilderness in the Western Cape. Since his car caught alight‚ more than 80 other Kugas caught fire on SA's roads‚ resulting in the global motoring giant having to recall over 4000 Kugas as part of several safety fixes to the vehicles.
