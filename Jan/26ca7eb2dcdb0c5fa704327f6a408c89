This is following the announcement by UK-based film and television production company Showbizbee that it had acquired the rights to film the story of late South African musician Brenda Fassie, affectionately called MaBrrr by her fans. The company said that the film would be written and directed by Edward Shaw with a script based on a story by her son Bongani. It is set to be released this year. Subsequent to the announcement, many tweeps took to the platform to share a list of SA actresses who would be perfect for the role. And many, including celebrities agreed Ngxoli would "nail" it. In a statement, Showbizee said: “Brenda, a period comedy-drama, follows a young Brenda Fassie whose determination to become a singer, follows her journey from Langa, Cape Town, to Soweto, Johannesburg, which catapults her into stardom becoming South Africa’s most iconic entertainer, along with becoming a mother.” By the end of yesterday, Twitter had already made a list of actresses which included: Nomuzi Mabena, Tina Jaxa, Manaka Ranaka and Soso Rungqu. Another lady who might land herself the role is Twitter user @sismabrrr Bathabile Ngubeni, who looks exactly like the late musician. @BlackBrainSA wrote: “Couldn’t agree more that @Ngxoli should play #BrendaFassie , there is no better Brenda that can play Brenda”, while @Clown17muncher said: “Soso = Morongwa would do a Great job she’s a good actress so she should be the one playing Brenda.” “If it’s not @sosovanderu , Brenda Ngxoli or Tina (singer), then you might as well get an American to play #BrendaFassie,” wrote @JustCuriousZA.
