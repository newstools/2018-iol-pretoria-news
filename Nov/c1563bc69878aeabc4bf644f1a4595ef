If you don’t believe that, try finding a reason why Caster Semenya is not on the list of the top five nominees for the Female World Athlete of the Year award. Yes, they can argue that the IAAF Council and the IAAF Family cast their votes by email, while fans voted online via the organisation’s social media platforms. But the bottom line is that the IAAF bodies hold 75% of the votes between them - the IAAF Council has 50%, and the IAAF Family 25%. Without their votes, Semenya stood no chance. But history will judge them harshly; the South African was unbeaten and set yet another national record in the 800m. The IAAF wants to introduce new regulations that will force athletes with hyperandrogenism to take testosterone-lowering medication if they want to keep competing. The track and field governing body refuses to drop its decade-long effort to lower Semenya’s testosterone, and its “conventional wisdom” is based on the assumption that her hyperandrogenism gives her an unfair advantage. Semenya is challenging the regulation, and you don’t have to be a sport expert to see that the IAAF is not taking this kindly - and that her defiance cost her the Athlete of the Year title. It is a sad day for athletics and sports in general when politics, and not brilliance, takes centre stage. Semenya is and will always be our World Athlete of the Year, with or without recognition from the IAAF.
