Pretoria - Poppie’s biological father Christo van der Merwe wept in pain at the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, as pre-sentencing proceedings were postponed despite the family’s desire to put the matter behind them. Poppie’s mother and stepfather, Louisa and Kobus Koekemoer, were found guilty of abusing and killing the three-year-old girl. They also abused another boy, 5, who cannot be named. The Van der Merwe family and members of the Go Purple Foundation were hurt and disappointed that Louisa’s defence refused to accept a pre-sentencing report in court on Wednesday morning. Subsequently, the compiler would need to come to court to testify in front of Judge Bam for proceedings to go ahead. However, the compiler refused to testify and wishes to remain anonymous.

She said the next report should be delivered to the mother’s defence a week prior to trial to avoid such postponements. An elderly man, Hylton Hofmeyr, who was touched by Poppie’s story travelled from Bronkhorstspruit to be in solidarity with the family on Wednesday morning. He cried when Poppie’s father read a letter he had written to the Van der Merwe family. His letter stated that he was heartbroken about what the two "agents of Satan" did to a helpless girl. News of what transpired in the last days leading up to Poppie’s death in 2016 at a provincial hospital in Brits left Hofmeyr with a broken heart. Poppie’s grandmother, Carla van der Merwe, said the family wanted this trial to be wrapped up because every time they came to court, old wounds were opened. The family wished to put this matter behind them and try to find peace knowing that the perpetrators were convicted. Pretoria News
