Fitzpatrick created the image in 1968 from a photograph of the Argentinian Marxist revolutionary taken in 1960 by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda, and made it available for free to anyone who wanted to use it. It was adopted by left-wing movements, appearing on T-shirts and posters, but has also been used by companies to brand products - something that annoyed Fitzpatrick and pushed him to reclaim the copyright in 2010.
