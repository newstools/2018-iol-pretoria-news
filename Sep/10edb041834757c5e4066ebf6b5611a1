The event featured diferent sporting codes such as football, netball, athletics and tug-of-war. Mayor Solly Msimanga graced the event with his presence and took part in a tug-of-war, which pitted councillors against senior municipal officials. After an epic round of pulling and pushing, a team of councillors led by Msimanga was defeated. Both teams went on to play football against each other and also particpated in the athletics.

The purpose of the event was to encourage communities to keep fit and active at all times. Participants also used an opportunity to undergo a full health check-up in the spirit of wellness. Msimanga said the occasion was important in terms of promoting social cohesion among communities. “The city also invited members of the community to participate, especially looking into the scourge of drugs in our townships. "There are people doing blood tests to check if people’s health is in good condition,” he said. He said it was important for councillors and officials to encourage people to be active in sport to ensure a healthy living. “This is something that we need to encourage more of our people to do. It is sad that many people discover that they have certain diseases way too late,” Msimanga said.
