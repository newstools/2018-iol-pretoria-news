This was just one of the many comments posted on social media after the artist arrived at the late freedom fighter’s home in Soweto to express his grief through art. Twitter users said the woman depicted wasn’t Madikizela-Mandela and that he needed to paint that “stranger in front of his own house”. Through his paintings, Sirenje has paid tribute to late celebrities and prominent figures, including former president Nelson Mandela Struggle icon Albertina Sisulu and gospel stars Lundi Tyamara and Sfiso Ncwane. But Sirenje’s painting of Madikizela-Mandela sparked controversy, with people claiming his paintings never depicted the intended people. The Madikizela-Mandela painting was described as disrespectful to the iconic woman. “Lebani Sirenje certainly had too much to smoke. He needs to go paint that stranger in front of his own house,” @dee_mongae tweeted. @Maguzwana said Sirenje was either a scam or had never seen a picture of Madikizela-Mandela. @ThatozSA suggested that the artist needed to be called to order and told the truth. “Who are these people that artist Lebani Sirenje is busy drawing? He needs to be called to order because clearly people have been lying to this guy,” wrote @ThatozSA. @Nomagugu concurred, suggesting that his studio needed to be broken into. “Someone needs to go break into Lebani Sirenje’s studio and steal his paint and brushes. We are tired of his disrespect,” @Nomagugu wrote. @Una_Ramaru wrote: “To be fair to Ras Lebani Sirenje, not all art is for everyone.”
