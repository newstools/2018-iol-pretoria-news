The suggestions come against a backdrop of foreign spaza owners being accused of selling counterfeit and expired products. More than 50 local shop owners met at the Mamelodi West Community Centre to find solutions. They spoke about the challenges they faced when competing against foreign shop owners, mostly Somalians. The majority of complaints were about the overly cheap pricing on products by their foreign counterparts. While they admitted competition was healthy, they said guidelines had to be adhered to to ensure competition was fair. Jabu Mfuni of Mamelodi Online Community, which convened the meeting, said competition had boundaries. “It should not include harmful business practices that cripple our counterparts,” he told shop owners. He suggested that a spaza association be established that would regulate and monitor their trading. “Just like the liquor association, you cannot just own a tavern without certain requirements. "We will ensure that people follow the statutes and rules instead of just opening spazas without meeting requirements." Another suggestion was the adoption of the “spider web” method, which was basically rotating money around local businesses, at least 10, before it could leave the community. Shop owners agreed they should support each other first before looking for help outside their communities. Spaza owner Tumelo Makaba said locals must have a sense of pride and not be jealous of supporting a fellow spaza owner. Some suggestions included creating a community banking system that would allow locals to buy in bulk like their foreign counterparts. Shop owners couldn’t verify the authenticity of a WhatsApp message doing the rounds that gave foreign shop owners until Saturday to shut down. They denied claims of any participation or incitement of violence. The meetings will continue throughout Mamelodi in the coming weeks. Today they will meet landlords who rent out foreign shop owners.
