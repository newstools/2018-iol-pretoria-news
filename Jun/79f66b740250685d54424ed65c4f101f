More than 2000 EFF protesters marched to Steve Biko Academic Hospital and Tshwane District Hospital today. Their aim is to rectify the poor service delivery at hospitals. The Minister of Health, Aaron Motsoaledi, recently confirmed that out of over 50 hospitals in the country only five are up to standard. EFF protesters have recently marched to George Makhado Hospital, Jubilee Hospital and Mamelodi Hospital in Tshwane to protest against bad service. According to the chairperson of the EFF in the City of Tshwane, Moafrika Mabongwana every month there will be a march to a different hospital around the city.

"The EFF are willing to do whatever it takes to be heard." "The EFF protesters aim to achieve excellent service delivery in all public hospitals". he said. One of the issues raised is that nurses are not treating patients properly. The EFF are also demanding that nurses get better salaries which will inspire them to do their jobs better.
