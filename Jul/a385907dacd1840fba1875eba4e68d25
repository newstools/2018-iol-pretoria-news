Dr Survé said everyone had a role to play in the fight to prevent violence against women and children. This new campaign, initiated by the government, resonated with Independent Media’s “Don’t Look Away” campaign that forms part of the 16 Days of Activism, he said. The #100MenMarch centres on the role of men in preventing violence against women and children. The campaign also aims to galvanise men across all sectors of society to respond to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s “Thuma Mina/send me” call by committing themselves to play their part in ending violence and abuse. The Pretoria News and #MakeSA Safe have joined forces in support of the #100MenMarch. It starts at the corner of Kgosi Mampuru and Madiba streets at 10am, past the Pretoria News to the Union Buildings. A number of high-profile South Africans from government and civil society will attend. A  pledge will be read out and signed. It  reads: Change begins with me, and I can motivate others to end violence against women and children. I pledge to help break the culture of silence that accompanies violence and abuse. I pledge not to commit violence, and to act when I see violence against women and children. I pledge to teach those in my care the values of human dignity, equality and respect. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee said his #MakeSASafe campaign dovetailed with the #100MenMarch. “We are appealing to men to come out in their hundreds. “Women are also welcome.  This has to be 365 days of activism,” he said. Pretoria News editor Val Bojé appealed to readers and city workers to join. The first 100 people to register with the Pretoria News will be given a march T-shirt (first-come-first-served basis).
