Wearing oversized green shorts and an even bigger smile, the little model strutted her new uniform which included green T-shirt and shorts and white socks and takkies. As it is custom on the first day of school, there are ubiquitous tears from both children and parents. But the effervescent young lady promised not to shed a tear and told the Pretoria News she was looking forward to starting a new journey. “I’m big girl and big girls don’t cry. I’m am excited for my first day at school,” she said. Tshegofatso admitted she would miss her friends from Grade R, but was even more excited to make new connections. “I can’t wait to play with my new friends on the jungle gym. We’re going to have lots of fun,” she said with a grin. Asked what else she was looking forward to, she replied: “”Reading, maths and netball.” The aspiring doctor wants to get good grades and help the sickly. “I want to pass well so I can be a doctor and help sick people,” she said. Tshegofatso is also watching her weight at a tender young age. She told her parents she preferred bread, biltong, apple, banana, naartjie and water to be packed in her lunch box. Her father Rey could hardly contain his excitement. “This is essentially what we hope for - seeing your young ones growing and excelling in life; it all starts here with school. It really is a proud moment for me as a father,” he said. What put him most at ease was that his other daughter Oratile was in the same school and would look after her sister. “She got strict orders to take care of her baby sister,” Rey said. Unlike all the other 28000 parents whose children were still not placed in schools, Rey said he found the online registration system to be a smooth process. “We didn’t experience any troubles whatsoever. It was a wonderful process,” he said. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said the province had placed only 2565 new pupils in schools for the 2018 academic year out of 32935 applicants. “Notwithstanding our efforts to get all parents to apply on time so that we can improve our planning processes, a total of 4500 new applications have been received since Saturday,” Lesufi said, adding that the system was under siege. “The number is expected to increase as parents are continuing to visit admission centres.” All department employees had been called in to try  to finalise applications by the end of February. Lesufi said, however, that everything was in place for classes to resume for Grades 2 to 7, as those pupils were already in the system as of last year. He said the department was bracing for challenges at Northridge School in Pretoria which had been rocked by allegations of corruption, and Bryneven School in Joburg, which parents had  threatened to shut down over a dispute over its administration. “We believe that all has been done to ensure a smooth start to the first day of school: that learning and teaching starts without any hindrance,” he added. - Additional reporting: African News Agency/ANA.
