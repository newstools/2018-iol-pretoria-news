The event to hand over the quilts was held at St Francis Church in Waterkloof. US co-ordinator of the Love Quilt project, Gretchen Ginnerty, said the idea was to share messages of love between local children and their peers in America. As part of the project, children in America crafted messages of love for the South African children. The messages were then stitched into the quilts. Ginnerty said: “The idea of stitching together messages from two countries for the common good of the children is the focus of the project.” Local children have already been asked to create messages of love for their American peers, who need their help. “I want them to send messages of love back which will be stitched into quilts,” Ginnerty said. She said the whole thing started in 2011 at the St Peters Church in Virginia, an affiliate of the St Francis Church. “They (the congregants of St Francis) were building one foster home for six children. "Our team in St Peters helped to raise money to help them build a home,” she said. She said that after completion of building the foster home, the Americans also brought them gifts of quilts. “I came up with this idea that we will just use the children in the church to create messages of love to South Africa,” she said. So far, about 400 quilts had been stiched to get to the South African children. Ginnerty said: “We focused on vulnerable children, mostly affected by HIV and Aids, "Also, children who have been orphaned.” Leader of Leamogetswe Safety Centre, Adolphina Phaladi, said: “We met the project organisers in 2016. "We are happy that today they are coming to donate to us for the second time. The donation has brought about changes in the lives of the children. Their quilts have messages of love which give the children hope for the future."
