The City of Tshwane on Friday took the healthcare services to a taxi rank in Bronkhospruit after a study conducted at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) that taxi drivers were at a huge risk of contracting the non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and HIV. Roads and Transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge said the risk was posed by the fact that most of the times taxi drivers didn't have time to go to clinics for check-ups because they were on the road for the whole day. "What we are doing now is to introduce the mobile clinic services. "They are going to have time at the taxi rank, even if it is for five minutes, to check their eye sight, their blood pressure and any other type of disease," she said. She also interacted with commuters and encouraged them to do check-ups in between getting in and out of the taxis.

She said the project was started in 2016 by the DA-led administration at Belle Ombre taxi rank. "This is an ongoing thing and not just a once-off introduction of the service and then we leave," she said. She said mobile clinics were not going to be permanent stations at the taxi ranks, but there were plans in the pipeline to make them permanent stations. "The ultimate goal is to get these mobile clinics at every taxi rank on a permanent basis," she said. The clinic was launched in partnership with the Gauteng Health Department, Tshwane Taxi Industry and the TUT's Adelaide Tambo School of Nursing Sciences.
