What does it mean to say to a woman “Happy Woman’s Day” without a meaningful gift? asked United Arab Emirates Ambassador Mahash Saeed Alhameli. He reached out to salute a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, Mama Sara Magagula in Mabopane, north of Pretoria, and has committed to refurbishing her home, giving her R10000 and taking care of her medical needs in the future. The UAE is celebrating the year of Zayed, in which emissaries provide humanitarian aid to countries, communities, and organisations which cater for the needs of the less fortunate members of society. Alhameli said the efforts of the embassy in this and other projects were in line with the 2018 Year of Zayed centenary celebrations. The UAE mission has since the start of the year donated over R5 million in various humanitarian projects throughout South-Africa. He saluted South African women on Women’s Day and said any country pursuing development could not have women in poverty and illiteracy and the UAE would assist in upholding women’s rights. - Staff Reporter
