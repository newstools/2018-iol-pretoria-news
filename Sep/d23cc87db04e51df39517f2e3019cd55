Clad in MTN-sponsored T-shirts, the group performed some of the songs from the Joyous Celebration 22 album. They were there to drum up support for their live performance scheduled for Time Square Arena on October 20. Kholofelo Mashao, a Joyous Celebration fan from Atteridgeville, said: “I am a fan of this group. I have all their DVDs. The moment I saw them here I had to come and see. I have already bought a ticket for the show (on October 20) and I can’t wait." One of the group’s founding members, Pastor Jabu Hlongwane, said they dedicated the day to spend time with the people from the capital and inform them that Joyous Celebration would be in the city. “We know a lot of local people come to our shows at Carnival City and other areas. This appearance is our way of saying we’re bringing a show in their backyard.” Joyous Celebration already visited Joburg, Cape Town, Durban, Mpumalanga, Bloemfontein and Botswana, among other places. Hlongwane said it was humbling that even after 22 years in the industry, they received a positive response from people during the tour. “There is no amount of wisdom that we could have to plan such a response after so many years. The show at Time Square Arena is very important for us because it will summarise the tour for us. "We have surprise guests and preachers who will be preaching for specific things,” he said. As October is known as Mental Health Month, Hlongwane said they knew that this was a serious issue and due to that they would be praying for that during the show. He said: “The show is also a thanksgiving show where we thank God for keeping us until now. Some people started the year on a positive note. For others their year hadn't been so great. We should thank God that through it all, the good and the bad, for He has kept us."
