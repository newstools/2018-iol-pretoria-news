Students at other TUT campuses finished writing last Friday. At Soshanguve North and South campuses, the exams started yesterday under a heavily armed security watch. Precious Sibanyoni, a second-year legal assistant student, said she started her exams on a good note. “I finished writing Labour Law, and I am happy because everything went well. I am confident I am going to pass this one.” She and other students spent six weeks at home after management suspended academic activities at both campuses at the end of August. The suspension of teaching followed protests after the death of Katlego Monareng. He was allegedly shot by police defusing tensions arising from SRC election disputes. Captain Joseph Rapoo, 51, and Constable John Slender, 40, were charged with shooting the third-year LLB student. They are on R2000 bail and will appear again on January 25 in the Soshanguve Magistrate’s Court. TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said the first day of exams at Soshanguve went smoothly. There were some students who did not have printed exam timetables, a prerequisite to be admitted to the exam venues. “They were assisted to print the timetables and start writing as scheduled.”
