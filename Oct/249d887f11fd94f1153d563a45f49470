Just like in other similar events, tutu skirts, colourful hairstyles, rainbow feather boas, funky outfits, glitter and extreme make-up literally coloured the venue on Saturday. The annual event attracted about 7000 LGBTQ community members who were dressed up in most spectacular circus-inspired outfits, including elderly couples. Gates opened at 9am. Organisers said the Pride had grown into one of the largest LGBTQ celebrations in the country. Festivities were aplenty for attendees, including live performers, DJs and drag artists to keep participants on their feet the entire time. There were also informative activities, including HIV testing stations and health information, as well as food stalls and plenty of alcohol. Executive mayor Solly Msimanga led a 5km parade, which got under way at 2pm, around the club. Organisers said it was the first Pride event in Africa to be publicly supported and attended by a mayor.
