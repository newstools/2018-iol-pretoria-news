While the ANC followed suit, the DA and its coalition partners continued to push through a number of items on the agenda. When the EFF and ANC councillors were physically out of chambers Lawack said there was no longer a quorum and voting discontinued. The EFF was unhappy because it had submitted a motion of intent on May 10 which was aimed at removing Trollip. However, the motion of no confidence among four other motions was not cited on the council agenda because paperwork had not met certain “requirements”. Other motions brought by the United Front and UDM sought to remove Lawack, chief whip of council Werner Senekal and rescind a council decision to dissolve the office of the deputy mayor. Notably absent from the council meeting was the UDM’s Mongameli Bobani. Councillor Zilindile Vena said the EFF was unhappy and accused Lawack of misinterpreting the rules to sideline the party’s motion. Vena requested Lawack to explain why he rejected the motions being heard at Thursday’s council meeting. Lawack responded that the EFF’s motion of no confidence in Trollip had to be submitted by May 9, according to the rules. “Do yourself a favour and read the rules. By my calculation it should have been handed in on May 9 by the latest. Ten clear business days before.” “Ten clear business days does not include the day of the council meeting it must be the day before,” said Lawack. Lawack refused to engage further with the EFF. Visibly agitated the red berets left council chambers, following suit were the ANC and the United Front. By midday the council meeting adjourned permanently. A special council meeting will now take place on May 30.
