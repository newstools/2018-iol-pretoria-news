Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said significant progress had been made in migrating social grants beneficiaries from the old card to the new gold one. But they were deeply concerned that despite the old white card having reached its expiry date, some beneficiaries were still holding on to them, risking losing their benefits. Just over 500000 of about 10.9million beneficiaries were still in possession of the old cards, he said. For this reason, Sassa and the Post Office were working tirelessly to migrate remaining beneficiaries on to the new cards. Acting Sassa chief executive, Abraham Mahlangu said: “We urge all remaining beneficiaries of social grants still in possession of the old card to urgently swop them for the new gold card. “We warn beneficiaries that soon we will no longer make any social grant payments into these old cards.” Beneficiaries can visit their nearest Sassa centre or Post Office to do a card swop, with their ID documents and the old card in a process that takes less than five minutes. Anyone who doesn’t swop their old cards for the new ones won’t be able to get their January 2019 grants,” said Letsatsi. Goitsemang Tlhabye
