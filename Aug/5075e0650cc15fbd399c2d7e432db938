Mugabe was accused of assaulting Engels, now 21, at a luxury hotel in Joburg last year. The Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg, this week set aside the decision to grant Mugabe diplomatic immunity by former minister of international relations and co-operation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Handing down judgment Judge Bashier Vally declared that granting Mugabe immunity was unlawful and unconstitutional. “I conclude that Dr Mugabe is not immune from the jurisdiction of our courts and the minister’s decision to ‘recognise’ or ‘confer’ immunity upon her was unconstitutional and unlawful,” read Judge Vally’s ruling. Engels said she graduated with a qualification in make-up artistry, and planned to use the networks she acquired while modelling to go into film production. “I have always been passionate about make-up, and I loved getting to learn about the finer details. “I am focused on getting the court case over and done, so that I can do what I love,” Engels said. She said wherever she goes she still gets questioned about the incident. “I want to move forward with my artistry,” she said. Face to Face Beauty & Make-up Design School offered Engels the bursary, which is valued at about R35000. Angela Botha acted as a link between the beauty school’s principal, Shirley Wenman, and Engels’s legal representatives. Botha had posted a message of support for Engels on a Facebook community group soon after the incident, which Wenman saw. The women soon interacted on the post, and Wenman asked Botha to liaise with AfriForum, which Botha said she did. AfriForum yesterday said: “Gabriella enjoyed each moment at the beauty school. “It was always a dream of her to attend beauty school and amazing people made it possible for her.” Wenman said Engels was the perfect student. “I would highly recommend Gabriella,” Wenman said.
