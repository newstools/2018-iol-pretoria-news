JAMES MAHLOKWANE Numerous employees of the Department of Health downed tools and protested for management to admit that its building was dilapidated and unsafe for occupation. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nahawu) and Public Servants Association of South Africa (Psa) led the  demonstrations at the building’s reception and security checkpoints. The workers said the building was beautiful on the outside  but it was terrible and dangerous on the inside. Scores of important and confidential documents were placed on pallets in numerous offices so that they did not get wet from water that rises up on the floors.

The workers said the roof and ceiling were leaking while some parts of the ceiling were falling in. They said the building has caused many workers headaches and sinus among other illnesses. “This place is a nightmare and management has been sitting on top of this issue for a long time and doing nothing about it. We are happy Nahawu and the Psa are pushing them to take action. We continue to get sick because we work in a building that does not meet occupation standards,” said an anonymous employee. Nahawu Secretary Mashudu Magagadeli said the union engaged management about the building when employees raised concerns about their health but management failed to address the problem.
