The plight of more than 10 000 residents of Refentse settlement near Hammanskraal would finally be alleviated, thanks to the installation ofÂ  a Soshanguve DD bulk pipeline that will deliver reliable potable water to the area. This was announced by Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga on Wednesday during an oversight visit to the Soshanguve DD reservoir, where a new pipeline has been installed to supply 10 000 households in Refense, also known as Stinkwater. The project to provide water to the residents was started five years ago, but it was affected by a number of obstructions. Msimanga said: "This, however, is changing under the DA-led multi-party administration." He said the City has conducted audits of pipes and other water infrastructure in various townships to determine the maintenance backlog and a plan to eliminate it.

"As a result of the collapse of water infrastructure due to age and leaks we have completed various projects for a water network replacement around the City of Tshwane," he said. He said it was the intention of his administration to see all residents getting access to a stable clean water supply. "We are confident that this recent installation is up to standard and that the people of Stinkwater will finally enjoy the level of service delivery they deserve. "This administration will continue to honour the commitment it made to all the people of Tshwane; to be a government that they can be proud of," he said.
