She recalls making him coffee at 3am and porridge for breakfast; the “sleepless” nights during the Codesa (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) talks, and the guests from around the world who he would spontaneously invite to the house to enjoy “our own home (traditional) food”. She recalls Mandela reading the newspaper on the front porch, and some family members who spent time with him at the house. It was here, she said, that it became clear he was to marry Graça Machel - after which they moved to another house nearby in the suburb. Now the house where Mandela lived from 1992 to 1998 - not far from the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory - is to be refurbished and turned into the Mandela Presidential Centre. The centre will support scholarships and encourage reflection on Mandela’s legacy, while giving travellers a unique experience. Mandela was a traveller, who made a difference to those he met and travelled with, said Sello Hatang, the chief executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation which owns the property, at the launch of the project as part of the Mandela centenary celebrations yesterday. The development is to be undertaken by the Thebe Property Asset Management and Thebe Tourism Group. Chief executive Jerry Mabena, said he was proud to be involved in such a project where Mandela’s memory and contribution to history would be preserved, and where future leaders could draw inspiration from his values and principles.
