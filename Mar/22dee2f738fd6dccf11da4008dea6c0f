james.Mahlokwane@inl.co.za Despite economic difficulties, tourism increased its total employment share from 4.2% to 4.4% and hired 17 945 more employees in 2016 compared to the previous year, said Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke. Maluleke delivered the Tourism Satellite Account report to the media for the first time yesterday at Tshedimosetso House in Hatfield. The statistics compared changes in the tourism sector between 2014, 2015 and 2016. According to the Statistician-General, by 2016, tourism contributed 2.9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employed an impressive 686 596 persons. This was 2.7% more workers than in 2015. Tourism exports increased by 11.6% to R121 400 000 while imports increased by 8% to R78 493 000 between 2015 and 2016. Domestic tourism expenditure also increased by 17.6% to R144 358 000. Maluleke revealed that tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) increased by 15.6% from R99 348 000 in 2015 to R114 850 000 in 2016. Meanwhile, Tourism direct domestic product (TDGDP) increased by 15% from R108 683 000 to R125 136 000. Tourism contributed 4.4% of the total workforce of 15.8 million workers in 2016. In fact, one in every 23 people was employed in the tourism sector. Most of the individuals in this sector worked in Road and Transport (29%), Food and Beverages (21%) and Accommodation (19%). Impressively, from the total tourism expenditure of R265.8 billion, international visitors were responsible for R46 of every R100 spent in 2016. However, despite positive trends in tourism, the office of the Statistician-General was still not in place to make recommendations to policymakers and leadership. "Statisticians have to avoid releasing stats as prescripts because that comes with a risk. Since we cannot guarantee what happens in the economy, in future, if our guidance does not confirm measurement, we will shy away from releasing our numbers. If that happens, we will lose our independence," Maluleke said his office was mandated to make its numbers available to the public and policymakers but what they did with that information was up to them. Maluleke told the Pretoria News that tourism impact was usually measured by its contribution to the GDP and that made it difficult to have precise statistics about Tshwane tourism alone. "However, this does not undermine municipal economies as they play a very crucial role in the sector and the economic well-being of the country. We have been able to narrow it down to the Gauteng, whereby we established that tourism contributed 35% of the the province's GDP."
