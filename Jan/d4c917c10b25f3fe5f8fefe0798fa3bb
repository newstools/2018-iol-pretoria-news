Legal Eagle, currently rated as South Africaâ€™s best horse, is the favourite at around 3-1 and he will be bidding to win the race for the first time after finishing runner-up in 2016 and 2017. There is also plenty of betting support for Marinaresco (9-2) and 3-year-old filly Oh Susanna (9-2). Apart from the main event there are three other Grade 1 races and also two $500000 races for 3-year-olds on the 13-race card. The huge pools generated are a massive attraction for punters and while there will be two Pick 6s on the day, the first one, which starts in race 4 with a R1.5m carryover, is set to reach a pool of around R7.5m. The quartet pool for the main race is expected to reach a total pool of around R5m. A day like this at the races is a huge social event and there will be plenty of glitz and glamour, razzmatazz  and a host of top celebrities, including athletics sprint sensation Usain Bolt. Punters, whether betting online or down at their local totalisator betting agencies, are advised to get their bets on early as there always seem to be a few hiccups on these big occasions. To catch all the action from the big day tune into Tellytrack on DStv channel 239 while the build-up and main race will also be screened from 15.20 on Channel 211.
