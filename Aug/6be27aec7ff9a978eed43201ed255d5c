This is according to the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which protested against the pair’s appointment to the ANC provincial executive committee (PEC). TAC members marched to the Gauteng provincial legislature demanding that Mahlangu and Hlongwa be booted out of the PEC. Proceedings inside the legislature were adjourned when the protesters arrived at the House. DA health spokesperson Jack Bloom said it had been a long fight in trying to hold the two accountable. “It has been over 10 years asking that Brian Hlongwa be charged for his role in collapsing the health system.” Mahlangu resigned following the deaths of 144 psychiatric patients in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Hlongwa is accused of facilitating corruption amounting to R1.2billion in the Gauteng Health Department during his tenure. Despite controversy surrounding the two, they were re-elected into the ANC PEC last month. “It is now 47 days since the Special Investigating Unit report was made public that implicates Hlongwa in massive corruption, but he has still not been fired, Bloom said. “How many more days before he is removed from the Gauteng Legislature and faces trial in court?” TAC national chairperson Sibongile Tshabalala said Premier David Makhura had shown disrespect in not meeting the protesters. “If the ANC wants our votes next year, they need to listen to taxpayers. “Minister [Aaron] Motsoaledi must know that he is not immune to our protests. “He cannot keep on saying he cannot make any decisions on provincial departments. He needs to take responsibility,” Tshabalala said.
