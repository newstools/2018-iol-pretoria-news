Pretoria - In celebration of the centenary of former President Nelson Mandela, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) launched its first commemorative banknote series at Freedom Park on Friday morning. A dazzling exhibition of the notes and R5 coin is set-up at the foyer for attendees to see. The larger than normal notes namely the R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200 depict Mandela’s historical journey from his birthplace to his last days. Governor Lesetja Kganyago said: “For the first time in its history of nearly 100 years, the SARB is launching commemorative banknotes and a third commemorative R5 circulation coin, in honour of our first democratically elected President, Nelson Mandela.” The R10 banknote is inspired by the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape, featuring Madiba’s humble birthplace of Mvezo. The R20 banknote features Mandela’s home in Soweto, where he defined his political life alongside other struggle icons. The R50 banknote depicts the site where Madiba was captured near Howick, following 17 months in hiding. This moment set in motion events that would change his life forever. As part of the celebrations, the South African Mint, a subsidiary of the bank, will also issue a new commemorative circulation R5 coin. The notes will be circulation by July 18. Among distinguished attendees were Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene, Ndileka Mandela and the Mandela Foundation and governors from Lesotho and Botswana. Pretoria News
