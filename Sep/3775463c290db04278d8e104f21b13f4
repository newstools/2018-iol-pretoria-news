Paul Molomonyane was, at the time, ward secretary in North West, and he said he had an alibi for the day of the killing. He explained that he was in hospital on December 13, 2012 when he and others were said to have conspired to kill Chika. The assassination took place the following day - Chika was shot in the driveway of his home in Klerksdorp. The 39-year-old never told police at the time of his arrest that he in fact had a “day pass” for about an hour, as he was admitted to Sunningdale Hospital in Klerksdorp for depression and “drinking too much beer”. This became evident only much later, as some witnesses insisted that Molomonyane was present at the River Lodge, where it was alleged that the murder plot was discussed. It was only recently that he claimed he obtained a day pass to “go and buy some taxi parts". Molomonyane was accused number two in the criminal trial of seven, charged with conspiracy to commit murder and murder. He was acquitted in November 2017, while his co-accused were convicted. Some were later acquitted following an appeal. Molomonyane instituted damages in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, consisting of R100 000 for humiliation for having to stand trial and R900 000 for the “discomfort” he had to suffer. He testified that he never attended the meeting, saying he was in hospital between December 13 and 14, 2012. He, however, admitted he had a pass to go and buy some spares, but said he was soon back in his hospital bed. Two prosecutors felt that his alibi was not watertight. Two witnesses claimed that he was part of the murder plot. One said he fetched Molo- monyane from hospital and took him to the lodge, and the other said he wanted Chika out of the way so that he could take his seat. Judge Dawie Fourie turned down this claim and said the prosecution could not be faulted for suspecting he was involved.
