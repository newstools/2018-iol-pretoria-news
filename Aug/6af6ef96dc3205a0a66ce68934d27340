The second-year civil engineering student became the team’s top goalscorer after netting one with a powerful header in the game against UJ (University of Johannesburg). He also did that last week against UKZN (KwaZulu-Natal University) and it seems to have become his trademark. One of the goals he’s most proud of was during last year’s Varsity game against UJ. The header kept his side on track to win the tournament. The 1.93m-tall Okolo loves the challenge of executing the perfect header. “But height is not always an advantage. Some shorter players can jump higher than tall players. To score a header is all about perfect timing. “I don’t want to take sole credit for any of the goals I scored as it takes team effort to head the ball into the net. Last week, Jeremiah Nkwana set up the goal perfectly.” Off the field, Okolo could be described as laid-back and composed which is in total contrast with what happens when he scores. “I can’t help myself. Every player dreams of that one moment when you get to score and change the outcome of the game. It is special.” Today, UP-Tuks take on Wits on home turf. It is a must-win game for UP-Tuks as they are currently fifth on the log with four points after three games. Wits are fourth with six points. As passionate Okolo is about football, he is also a realist. Getting his degree is essential. He admits that at times it can be difficult finding time to study between practice and attending classes. “I owe a lot to Ricardo Katza the former SuperSport United and Bafana player. He coached me while I was playing for SuperSport’s reserve team. “He kept on emphasising that no sports career lasts forever. So he encouraged me to study. “Some people have criticised me for studying and playing. They argue that I should solely focus on football.” - African News Agency (ANA)
