It is indicated that the cause of her “death” was natural - but the Pretoria North mother is very much alive and healthy. Yesterday she shared the horrors of being unable to access her savings, apply for a new job and register her newborn son, among other things. She has a death certificate indicating that she died in May 2015; the certificate has an ID number similar to hers. The 26-year-old, originally from Durban, said she had found out about her “mysterious demise” last year when she went to withdraw money from the bank. She recalled being told “we can’t give you the money because you are deceased”. On hearing this, Maphumulo said she immediately turned to Home Affairs in Akasia to ask them to fix the problem. “I went to the bank and asked the tellers to take out some money, and I was told they could not because I was deceased. I went to Home Affairs and they told me that maybe someone had a duplicate ID. “It has been almost a year that I’ve been trying to sort this thing out. I have filled out forms and was told to give it six months, but still nothing. “I had savings but I can’t even access the money since all my bank accounts are frozen. I can’t even apply for a job,” she said. Maphumulo said she had gone as far as providing Home Affairs with her Grade 1 progress report to prove that she was still alive. “I got a copy of my birth certificate, injection card, discharge card, a letter from my primary school but they also want a copy of my register, which the school no longer has,” she said. Maphumulo got married last year, but can’t change her last name because of the matter. Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said they would get in contact with the victim in a bid to sort out the matter promptly. “We have instituted an investigation into the matter. The office manager for Home Affairs in Akasia will contact Ms Maphumulo with a view to resolving the issue promptly.”
