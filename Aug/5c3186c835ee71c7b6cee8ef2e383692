Pretoria - Former air force sergeant Samuel Mandla Madonsela, serving life for shooting and killing an officer and wounding another in 2007, is on a hunger strike after being refused permission to bury his sister two weeks ago. A source close to the inmate, from Zonderwater Correctional Services in Cullinan, told the Pretoria News that Madonsela was on his sixth day without food and water. “He is prepared to go further until his demands are met. This guy believes that rights of inmates sentenced to life are violated because he couldn’t bury his sister, and was told he had to wait at least 10 years before being allowed to attend funerals.” Madonsela has only served seven years. The source said the inmate was demanding a meeting with the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Michael Masutha. “He is demanding to see the National Commissioner of Correctional Services, Arthur Fraser, and then the minister otherwise he will continue going hungry,” the source said. Madonsela shot dead Lieutenant-Colonel Authon Dominic Stevens and wounded Lieutenant-Colonel Isak Karan at Thaba Tshwane Air Force College on November 8 2007. He was sentenced to life in prison by the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, in 2011, by Judge Peter Mabuse, who gave him life for murder and seven years for attempted murder. Karan spent two weeks in the intensive care unit of a hospital and returned to work a month later. Madonsela was absorbed into the defence force in 1994 and he served for 14 years until being discharged after the shooting, which was sparked by his rejection after a course called Officer Formative Course at the Thaba Tshwane Air Force College. During his bail application, he claimed he was kicked off the course as he was told he was a "redundant k****r who would never serve in any office of the Defence Force". The Department of Justice and Correctional Services are yet to comment. Pretoria News
