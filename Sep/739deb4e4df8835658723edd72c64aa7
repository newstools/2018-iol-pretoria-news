During the event, more than R2million was raised to buy them Christmas parcels this year. The annual gala dinner saw private sector donors pledging to donate money and hampers towards the Goodwill Parcel Project. The project was started in 2001 with a view to benefit soldiers in deployment over the festive season, as well as their families back at home. SANDF chief, General Solly Shoke, said the project was an opportunity for local businesses and other generous sponsors to reach out and thank “soldiers who continue making a supreme sacrifice”. He said donations would also benefit soldiers’ families, “who play a pivotal support role, allowing our soldiers to safeguard our borders and promote peace and stability on the continent”. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who was at the dinner, thanked the sponsors for their generous donations and encouraged more companies to come on board and donate towards the good cause. “My wish is that we have more and more of the business community coming to the party, so as to grow this basket of goodwill that is expressed,” she said. Mapisa-Nqakula said the project had been started by warrant officers 18 years ago. She expressed the hope that the generals would be able to build on the work done since the project's humble beginning. The minister added that the project exposed sponsors to the contribution made by the armed forces in protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
