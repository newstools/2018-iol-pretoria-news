Even the rain which fell in the afternoon did not discourage the taxpayers, some of whom had travelled from far and wide. Penalties for missing the deadline range from R200 to R15 000. Letumile Mametsa from Atteridgeville said it was her third attempt to file her tax returns. “The first time I came here they cut the queue and told us to leave. On the second day I thought the queue was too long and left.” She admitted that ignorance had also played the part in her submitting her tax returns on the last day. “I always thought I had time, now look at me today. But I will wait to be assisted whether it rains or not.” Mametsa, however, pleaded for the taxman to offer workshops on e-filing. “We are here because we don’t know how to use the e-filing.” Phomolo Maboshego was also in the queue and said she did not have a reason not to file her tax return on time. She said she had travelled from Lebotlwane in the North West to submit her tax return. “It is sad that Hammanskraal does not have any branch and we have to travel all the way to town to make our submissions,” she said. She suggested there should be branches in other areas as well in order to avoid long queues. Sharing the same sentiments was her friend Phindulo Ramatsea, who said called for mobile centres in townships during the tax season.
