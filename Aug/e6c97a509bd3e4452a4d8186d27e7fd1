The Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) and other civil organisations have given National Treasury 14 days to respond to their demands. The response must be accompanied by an action plan to deal with the increasing levels of illicit trade in the country.

Fawu General Secretary Katishi Masemola called on the department to act decisively against illegal manufacturers. “What we cannot allow is that VAT regressive as it is as a tax system can be increased, the fuel levy is going up and all this affects the working class communities negatively, yet you leave illicit traders running amok. “You can’t tolerate unlawful activities, illegal manufacturing and claim that it helps to promote competition, things don’t work that way,” he said.

Masemola said not only tobacco was affected by illicit trade but other products too. “By the way, the issue of illicit trade does not only affect tobacco or cigarettes but it affects a number of products and National Treasury is aware of that,” he said. Lwazi Giba received the memorandum on behalf of Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and promised marchers he would personally deliver the memorandum to the minister.
