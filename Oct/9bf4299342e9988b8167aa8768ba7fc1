The communal spirit and facilities that the city has to offer for people like us artists as well as clubs and parks. What things would you change if you were the mayor? We would change the social welfare system in our communities and ensure active intervention in this regard.

What do you think the advantages are of living in the city? You are closer to facilities that can enable growth and easy networking. What job do you do and does it satisfy you? Music, and yes, it is extremely satisfying. We cannot imagine doing anything else. If you moved away from the city where would you go? The countryside, exactly the opposite of Pretoria.
