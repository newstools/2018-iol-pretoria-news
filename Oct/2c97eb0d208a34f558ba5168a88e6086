His former wife convinced the judge that she suffered from battered woman syndrome which rendered her helpless to protect her children, and he gave her a five-year suspended sentence. She will attend therapy during this time, and it seems unlikely she will be reunited with her children. While the father said in a media interview he loved his children and would welcome the opportunity to apologise to them for the abuse and neglect they suffered, it is clear they want nothing to do with him. In a letter presented to the court the eldest daughter and son made it clear they hate their father and cannot forgive him. If we are to protect the children in our communities from such abuse we need to ensure there is help for those who have been abused so that they do not repeat the cycle with their children. We need good role models, especially men, and we need to be alert and report any suspicious behaviour to protect children who may be in danger. The impact of drug and alcohol abuse and emotional disorders cannot be wished away. Our hope is that the children have found a safe, loving home, and now that the case is over can continue to heal and have a happier future.
