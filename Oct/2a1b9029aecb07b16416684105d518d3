The party conducted its second oversight visit to the embattled centre; it initially went there in June. This time, party officials said they liked what they found. Provincial leader John Moodey said their unannounced visits yielded results and officials and staff were kept on their toes. “We like what we see. More efficiency, shorter queues and a general ambiance of synergy in the centre. It has been a major improvement from the previous time and when we were denied access.” Moodey, along with spokesperson on immigration Jacques Julius, conducted the visit amid allegations of corrupt officials exploiting vulnerable asylum-seekers by taking bribes to secure assistance from the department. Despite the improvements, some foreigners still had complaints, which included solicitation of bribes by officials and the prevalence of robberies outside the centre. Moodey suggested a satellite police office be set up outside the centre to keep an eye on criminals and ensure faster response time.
