“I am honoured to preside over this National Orders ceremony to honour those among us who have made outstanding contributions to our country, and to the broader global community,” the president said in his capacity as the Grand Patron of the National Orders. The ceremony was attended by various dignitaries. “These national orders are a recognition of the many outstanding individuals who defied great odds to make an immense contribution in various spheres of life. “Our freedom opened windows of opportunity for many to chase their dreams, to excel, to succeed, and in so doing to inspire others to reach beyond what they imagined possible,” Ramaphosa said. - SAnews.gov.za
