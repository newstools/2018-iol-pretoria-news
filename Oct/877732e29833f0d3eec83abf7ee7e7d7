The recent University Sports SA (Ussa) final played in Durban on September 24 was contested by Tuks and the University of the Western Cape. But this time it was sweet revenge for the Capetonians as they triumphed with a score of 2-0. Last year Tuks dominated student beach volleyball, winning the Varsity as well as the Ussa tournaments. Tuks defender Khutso Letsoalo received the Defender of the Tournament Award. Dominique Gachet said she could not have asked for a better teammate. “Khutso was brilliant. I knew when the ball was passed to me that there was no need to worry. "She makes sure the ball stays in play,” she added. The next challenge for the two will be to try to get selected for the Tuks indoor volleyball team. The side is going to compete in the Zone Six Tournament. - African News Agency (ANA)
