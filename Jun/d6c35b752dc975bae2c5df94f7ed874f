The families, including young children, have to jump over pools of sewage to enter and leave their homes near the M20 road. They have lived in the houses since 2013, having moved from the nearby Nkandla informal settlement. The houses are at the bottom of the slope. Most of the sewage is believed to leak from houses up-slope,” said 55-year-old residentMagdeline Mabila. “It angers me that everyone’s sewage comes down to us. This is because we are at the bottom of this slope. We have been reporting this, but after being repaired, the problem recurs. “We have children, and they just play with everything because they do not know what is bad or good for their health. We have to cook and eat in this situation every day. “The worst part about living here is drinking the water. You don’t even want to look at what comes out of the taps,” she said. Some of the residents at house numbers 23239 to 24243 have back rooms, which are also affected by the sewage. Behind Mabila, a shack was last week surrounded by a pool of sewage water. Mabila’s neighbour was said to have given up on his home and was temporarily living elsewhere. Other residents have to step on bricks and stones to enter or leave their rooms Dockus Ngobeni, 47, said: “It is painful to raise children in a yard where things like used condoms, tissues and newspapers pop out of the drain.” Thandi Malose, 42, said she used to report the leaks and contractors would come to fix the leaks, but they had stopped coming. She said she feared for the health of her children and neighbours. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said they would intervene and provide a solution as speedily as possible. He encouraged residents to report all challenges to municipal offices and retain reference numbers. “Indeed such cases pose health threats, hence we always encourage residents to report as speedily as possible to ensure such cases receive prompt attention. Reporting is key so we could tackle the issues as they arise.”
