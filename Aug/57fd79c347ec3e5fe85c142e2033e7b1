Malema addressed thousands of his parties’ supporters at the Caluza Sports Centre in Edendale, Pietermaritzburg, during his party’s Women’s Day celebration. Malema said the heroes and heroines of South Africa’s liberation Struggle not only included stalwarts such as Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Robert Sobukwe and Steve Biko. “You must tell them that our leaders include Lillian Ngoyi, you must tell them that our leaders include Winnie Mandela because women are important in every revolution. “You cannot claim victory if you don’t tell the honest truth about how women have claimed this land,” added Malema. He added that many think that when women marched to the Union Buildings in 1956 they were doing so because they were refusing to carry the dompas. “That was not the real story, the women were saying: ‘Why do you want us to carry the dompas in our own land? This is my land and I will never be treated like a foreigner in my own land’,” the commander-in-chief of the Red Berets said. He said that the march was not about the dompas in isolation. “The boers wanted to treat African people as if they are foreigners in South Africa and the women said ‘no we’re not foreigners here, this is our land, (JG) Strijdom take your dompas because we don’t need it, we want free movement in our own land’,” Malema said. Malema spoke for almost an hour at the event, and highlighted the abuse of women, in particular the rape and killing of women. He said university student Khensani Maseko did not take her own life; the man accused of raping her did. He said that when a man raped a woman he took away her soul and she had no life left. He berated men who rape grandmothers, and spoke out on the so-called rape culture at Rhodes University, and called on the EFF Student Command to fight this culture. He said if the university listened to women students when they expressed their concerns, Khensani’s rape might not have happened.
