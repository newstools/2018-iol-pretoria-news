They are Anzelle van Staden, from Centurion, and Taryn Bornman, from Pretoria East. More than 300 applicants were put through their paces at Carnival City last weekend before the final 14 were selected. Miss South Africa 2018 will be crowned on May 27 at the Time Square Sun Arena in Pretoria. The winner will take the crown and more than R2million in prizes. Miss South Africa dates back to 1956, when Norma Vorster was crowned and represented South Africa at Miss World held in London. Two years later, an 18-year-old secretary from Durban, Penny Coelen, was crowned and would later go on to make history and win Miss World. Since then, more than 60 women have worn the Miss SA crown, with the current title holder, Dr Ad√® van Heerden, a medical doctor in the South African Military Health Services. She was first runner-up to Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, who handed over the title when she was chosen as Miss 
Universe.
