Speaking to radio presenter Redi Tlhabi at the Discovery Leadership Summit in Sandton, Semenya said her fight was not only about her own future as an athlete but for young aspiring girls who may be influenced by the rules. “To be honest this is not about me, I’ve achieved everything I want to achieve in life I was sitting at home thinking I can’t let this thing go on; what about the next generation? It is killing them,” Semenya said. “What about those young girls who still want to run who are in the same situation as I am? It means their dreams would be shattered. “Someone needs to do something about it, so I told my team we need to fight this thing, enough is enough. “I just wanted to piss them off a bit; sorry, it is just the way I am. I want to show them that what they are doing does not make sense.” The regulations are limited to athletes who compete in events ranging from the 400m to the mile which was coincidentally Semenya’s best distances. The IAAF introduced the policy in April and would attempt to regulate women who naturally produce testosterone levels above five nanomoles per litre of blood. The regulations were supposed to go into effect yesterday, but the IAAF had agreed to place the matter on ice pending the outcome of the proceedings in front of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS proceedings are expected to take place in February with a ruling handed down by March. Semenya questioned the logic of the IAAF’s decision to regulate women who naturally produced high levels of testosterone. “Once you start classifying women, it is a problem. If you want to classify those in the 400m, 800m and 1500m, I say okay, then I will move to sprints and see what you can do about it,” Semenya said.
