Tshwane Emergency Services' spokesperson, Johan Pieterse has confirmed that one person was killed when multiple shacks caught fire again at the Plastic View informal settlement, east of Pretoria on Monday morning. It is unclear what caused the fire. “We can confirm we have one deceased person that was burnt in a shack and we transported three seriously injured patients to hospital.” Pieterse said they were still investigating what caused the fire. More than 400 shack dwellers were left displaced. This follows yet another fire that gutted 50 shacks, leaving almost 500 homeless on Saturday. There are two parts of Plastic View divided by the Woodlands Mall. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

We were called here just after 2am...on arrival multiple shacks were on fire and obviously we tried our best to cut off the fire from spreading throughout the whole squatter camp and we did manage to get it right,” Pieterse told the Pretoria News. He said they were yet to confirm how many shacks were burnt to the ground. “The cause will be investigated, there are a lot of rumours, some say it's arson, some say it was a grass fire and some say it's an open fire that was not extinguished. It is difficult to get to the cause of these fires but we will try our best to speak to community members because they must guide us in the right direction so that we can do the investigation,” he said.
