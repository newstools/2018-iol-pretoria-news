Makgabo said he made it thanks to the dedication, patience and understanding of social workers he met along the way to recovery. In a special ceremony organised for auxiliary social workers at the Heartfelt Arena, Thaba Tshwane, Makgabo said drug addicts, the elderly, children and the vulnerable could never thank social workers enough for the work they did. In addition to being Human Rights Day, yesterday was International Social Work Day. Makgabo said he was introduced to drugs at the age of 16 and eventually got into substances like nyaope and heroin at 21. Taking the first step to finally quit drugs, he said the help of social workers at various centres he went to  ensured he finally managed to quit, despite several relapses. He said: “The social workers at Social Development, rehabilitation centres and after care centres are the reason I stand here a changed person and wanting to do my bit for other youngsters. “It’s one thing for a person to tell you what to do, but when it’s planted like a seed it becomes your own conviction. That’s what they did for me, they planted the seed that I was better than drugs, that despite what I had done I was great.” The MEC for Social Development, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, said although there were exceptions, the overwhelming majority of social workers came into the profession genuinely wanting to help society. She encouraged the social workers present to not only look after the communities they served, but to also look after themselves. Mayathula-Khoza said commemorating International Social Work Day and Human Rights Day was important as social workers helped many people enjoy their rights with dignity.
