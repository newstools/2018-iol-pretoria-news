Premier David Makhura on Wednesday unveiled a multi-purpose sports facility in Itireleng informal settlement near Laudium. He said the facility would go a long way in keeping young people off from the streets, where they were vulnerable to the use of drugs. The facility caters for a variety of sport disciplines like tennis, netball, basketball and soccer. Makhura said its construction was made possible through a partnership between the Gauteng City Region and the Sports Trust. It was built after the community told Makhura about a need for a sport field in the area during government's service delivery outreach programme called Ntirhisano in June this year. "The complaints from the parents were that there was no place for their children to play," Makhura said. He told residents during the opening ceremony that the City of Tshwane would erect the ablution facility. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

He stressed that the main purpose was to contribute to a fight against drugs by making sure young people participate in sport. "We don't want to find you in the shebeen," he said. Makhura, who also took some time out to play football with the local boys, handed over sport equipment such as tennis rackets, balls, soccer and netball kits to children of both Itireleng and Laudium.
