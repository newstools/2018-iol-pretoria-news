A contingent of Crime Intelligence officers stormed into Jacaranda FM's studios in an on-air prank involving comedian Desmond Dube, who was playing the part of a corrupt cop and arrested him. It started when Scenic Drive host Rian van Heerden complained about the modus operandi of some police officers who he said were too eager to take bribes from motorists. He then invited Dube on to the show on Thursday to play the character of a corrupt cop on air. Dube “made such an impression” that police reacted swiftly and arrived at the radio station’s Midrand base, ready to arrest the “corrupt official” shortly after the interview. On arrival, they found out that the cop was actually the much-loved entertainment veteran. Police were applauded for the quick response. After the incident Van Heerden told listeners: “To me, it’s a great sign there are people who are being activated to make sure corrupt cops do not spoil the work of the police.” Van Heerden said provincial police commissioner Deliwe de Lange was alerted to the “corrupt cop” interview.
