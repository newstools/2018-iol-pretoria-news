Pretoria - Business owners and motorists this morning expressed happiness following the reopening of the Jean Avenue and Gerhard Street intersection in Centurion after its closure due to the long standing sinkhole. The intersection was closed following the formation of a sinkhole over two years ago, causing major inconvenience in the neighbourhood and  disruption to business and traffic flow in Centurion. Popular eatery the News Café was among the businesses forced to close down as a result. Mayor Solly Msimanga, MMC for Transport, Sheila Lynn Senkubuge, and councillor David Farquharson of Ward 57 were on site to officially reopen it. The total cost of repairs was more than R25-million, according to Msimanga. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
