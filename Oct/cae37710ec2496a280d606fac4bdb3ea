Something had to give - and it was thus refreshing to hear Premier David Makhura yesterday putting his foot down. He declared that those not supposed to be staying in Extension 27 would finally be removed. Another defining moment was when Makhura stood up to hooligans - including a group in the colours of the ANC that he leads - that attempted to disrupt the public meeting. This habit, normally dished out to Tshwane leadership in the cityâ€™s townships, has been allowed to continue for too long. Those not wanting to listen to what the leaders have to say should not attend meetings. Makhura, in calling the group to order, reminded them he had a right to visit any community. Much as the occupants of the house will not like it, it cannot be business as usual when houses built for deserving beneficiaries are occupied unlawfully. Despite a court order to that effect, the occupants have steadfastly refused to vacate the houses. They have gone as far as declaring that they would rather die than move out of the houses. This impasse was destined to end badly, and Makhura reiterated the same stance and threatened to enlist the services of Amaberete Tactical Response Unit should the situation so demand. We hope the verification of the rightful occupants of the houses will be completed and those who should not be staying in Extension 27 are removed.
