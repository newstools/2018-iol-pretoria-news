The students rolled up their sleeves yesterday and cleaned up the premises of Sunnyside Primary School and its immediate surrounds. Organiser Thabo Mahlangu said the students were affiliated to the International We Love You Foundation in South Africa, which started its work seven years ago. “We believe that if everyone has the heart of a mother, the world we live in would be a much more beautiful place,” Mahlangu said. He said volunteers were inspired to help people who lived in less unfortunate circumstances. “The organisation was engaged in activities such as clean-up campaigns, blood donations and the installation of boreholes in places where there is no water. We have been embarking on different clean-up campaigns in major cities such as Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg,” he said. Volunteers were encouraged to take part in the campaign in Sunnyside because they wanted to contribute towards changing a negative perception about the suburb. “The place has a bad reputation and we thought that if that place could be cleaned of diseases, crime and grime it would improve. “The hope is that through cleaning up we are going to inspire the community to take care of its environment. We hope that more community members will take part and inspire others to do the same to sustain the campaign,” Mahlangu said. The organisation received support from the City of Tshwane, which donated plastic bags, gloves and brooms. “The support from the City is truly appreciated because with every clean-up that we have they are always willing to support us with those items,” he said.
