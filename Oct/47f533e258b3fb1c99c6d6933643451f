It’s been three days since the video of four men from France doing choreography to the Ghanian-born singer Ebony's hit song 'Kupe" broke the internet, but social media is still going bananas over it. The video sparked a trend and now people have been trying it out. While most dance challenges are quick to become old news, the #KupeChallenge is still the talk of the town —largely due to the four-man squad's good looks. The moment the video started making rounds on different platforms, girls could not help but notice the good looks, which has left many guys bitter.

One Facebook user went as far as hunting the guys down and sharing their Instagram handles.  Chesly Armellin: “Girls, remember the music video of the 4 Chocolate guys yesterday? The men of our lives.
