Pretoria - Social media users have turned humour around Vusi Nova’s hit song Asiphelelanga, flooding different platforms with memes and videos. Despite the song paying tribute to fallen heros, tweeps and facebookers have decided to overlook that aspect and interpret it in a complete different way. Asiphelelanga - loosely translated from Zulu - means we are not complete. The song has been trending on social media since its release two months ago and has been getting a lot of airplay on various radio stations. The song, featuring poet Jessica Mbangeni, pays tribute to Mzansi artists who have died. But social media reared its humorous head again, taking to their gadgets to flood different platforms with memes and videos. One of the memes shared rapidly is that of a group inmates wearing orange overalls captioned: “Asphelelanga kushot’uOmotoso,” translated- Omotoso is missing in the picture. Tim Omotoso is the senior pastor of a Jesus Dominion International, based in Durban, who is currently on trial at the Port Elizabeth high court for rape and human trafficking. Those mentioned in the song are artists like Sfiso Ncwane, Robbie Malinga, Miriam Makeba, Lucky Dube and Ray Phiri, Brenda Fassie,  Nana Coyote, Busi Mhlongo and Mandoza.
