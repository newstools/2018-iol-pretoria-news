International aircraft were returning to their home countries, while the domestic aircraft went back to their permanent stations after spending a week in the city. A finale demonstration of military action simulated by soldiers in times of war, wowed the audience before a marching band played their goodbyes to everyone. Military helicopters, explosives, parachute divers and guns were put to good use during the finale, while large crowds of families, friends and children recorded the moment with their smart devices to relive the experience later. People begun arriving in their numbers at 6am on Saturday. Sunday wrapped up what was a fun weekend with adults and children having the opportunity to take pictures inside various aircraft and defence vehicles. With the event only taking place every second year, it was no surprise that many were prepared to brave the heat of the intense Pretoria weather just to catch a glimpse of the breathtaking technology on display. Aerospace and defence creators, marketers and innovators proudly exhibited defence equipment such as missiles, bombs, automatic firearms, bullet-proof vehicles, robots and ammunition to the crowd. Between Wednesday and Friday, the show was exclusively for trading purposes for delegates and business people. Only pupils on special invitation were granted access for the purposes of learning about possible aviation and defence careers from the Africa Aerospace and Defence Youth Development Project team. Organisers said they were proud to have hosted another successful show.
