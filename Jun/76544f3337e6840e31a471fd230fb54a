Due to demand, an additional show has been added to the schedule with tickets available for Saturday at 3.30pm. The show is based on the successful children's TV series, with Peppa taking on a new adventure after Polly Parrot and Mr Dinosaur have disappeared, leading Peppa, George, Mummy and Daddy Pig to embark on an incredible journey to find them. The immersive musical show - which features life-sized puppet characters - has its young audience laughing, cheering, singing and dancing, and has received rave reviews from parents. “Children were off their chairs, stomping their feet, wiggling their bums and singing along to songs like the Bing Bong song and other popular nursery rhymes,” said one review. “Watching the reaction to a made-up cartoon character appear on stage is beyond belief,” said another. “At 80 minutes long, we were concerned that our terrible two might not go the distance, but she was riveted throughout,” noted another. “The characters urged the audience to participate and all the singing, dancing, oinking and jumping in muddy puddles kept the children well entertained.” Special VIP tickets with a meet and greet, and affordable family packages, are available for the show. Booking at Computicket.  For more information about the show, visit the website www.peppapiglive.co.za or stay in touch via social media.
