MultiChoice made the announcement earlier in the day, months after allegations surfaced that the pay-TV company had made a questionable payment of R141million to ANN7 for its former owners, the Gupta family, to pressurise government to push through a decision in favour of set-top boxes which would benefit MultiChoice. The company denied those allegations. In a statement, Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said that the government would not get involved on contractual matters between two private parties. “I wish to express my disappointment that viewers of DStv will not have access to the diversity of voices that ANN7 has also contributed to the country's media landscape,” Kubayi-Ngubane said. “However, there is a lesson to be learnt going forward in that, as government, we need to look at how our current policies are structured in relation to increasing diversity of media ownership.” The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has since said that it would be investigating MultiChoice over allegations of payments made to ANN7 and the SABC. MultiChoice also said that in a bid to replace ANN7 on DStv, it was looking at finding a new black-owned news channel which represents the majority of people in South Africa, something that pleased Kubayi-Ngubane as a “progressive move”. “It is imperative to ensure that there is diversity of media ownership bringing new and fresh perspective to the people of South Africa,” Kubayi-Ngubane said. - African News Agency (ANA)
