At about 8am, about 45 people descended on the waste management depot in Block A, Mabopane, broke down the security gate, and burnt the stock of waste bins, an asbestos office and a kitchen. They also damaged the security cubicle and toilet windows. The Rosslyn fire division was quickly dispatched to the depot to extinguish the fire. “The former employees have been responsible for a series of disruptions of services and causing chaos across the city since the beginning of this year after the expiry of their contracts,” City spokesperson Selby Bokaba said. “We call upon law enforcement to take action against those who have been vandalising the City’s assets and intimidating our employees. “No amount of intimidation and thuggery will deter us from continuing to deliver services to our people. A case docket has been registered with the local police.” The EPWP was a national initiative aimed at reducing unemployment and alleviating poverty through the creation of short-term work opportunities and the use of labour-intensive methods. Bokaba said the reformed EPWP recruitment policy framework was passed by the council on September 28 last year as a principle of good governance. Bokaba said: “Recruitment of personnel was done in a transparent and fair manner. “The City embarked on a recruitment campaign late last year and managed to register more than 120000 potential beneficiaries on our central database. The programme was renamed ‘Gata Le Nna’, which means ‘Walk with me’. “One of the proposed amendments to the revised policy included the selection of eligible beneficiaries through an open and audited lottery-
like system. “In December last year, the executive mayor, Solly Msimanga, oversaw a lottery of over 3000 beneficiaries for the EPWP, some of whom commenced their duties at the beginning of the year.”
