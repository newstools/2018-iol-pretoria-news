Makhura hoped that a South African choir would win, unlike the 2010 Fifa World Cup when the country bowed out in the group stages. “Our people love choral music. Every time I go to a funeral or school event I am amazed; choral music is one of the things engraved in our blood,” he said during a visit to the Pretoria News offices. Makhura said the concerts taking place in communities across the city would give people a chance to enjoy choral music and also afford visitors a taste of ubuntu that South Africans were known for worldwide. That, he said, could be done through the offering of traditional food and humanity. At Tshwane House, it was a morning out of the ordinary as local choirs, including the Light of Hope, the Tshwane University of Tech- nology and Voices of the World, paid a courtesy visit to the mayor, Solly Msimanga. World Choir Games artistic committee member and legendary musician Sibongile Khumalo, adjudicator Mohau Mogale and the creative director and producer of the opening ceremony, Hlubi Kwebulana, were among the group. Msimanga told the choristers: “We want you to be ambassadors of the city. We want you to show the world that we are forces to reckon with,” he said. Mogale said he looked forward to the experience of being an adjudicator during the festival. “It is a privilege to be part of this. It shows that the reputation that I built over the years did not go unnoticed.” Billed as the World Cup of choral music, the festival is the battleground for the finest talent from around the world. In all, 62 countries are taking part, all in the name of building bridges between nations through music and song. See Page 5
