Dr Heng Koong from Singapore said educating the public was the best way to start creating a tobacco free generation. He said this to City officials looking to create a tobacco free Tshwane and others gathered at the CSIR Convention Centre today. He said he focused on a tobacco free generation when he eventually grew tired of delivering bad news that his patients died of lung cancer or other lung related diseases. "I started this movement because I was touched by a young lady who died due to lung cancer. "She didn't smoke but both her parents did and as a result, like her parents, she too died of lung cancer. So I grew tired of delivering bad news and decided to target young people both smoking and non-smoking in order to make a difference," he said.

Koong said in order to be able to keep the youth interested, one needed to be able to use the same communication as the youth, and due to that he got medical students who were interested in the programme and were able to communicate with their peers in the same "lingo". Koong said: "Young people have so much power in society and if we can get them to not even start smoking then we will have a tobacco free generation." According to the World Health Organisation tobacco kills more than 7 million people each year. Most die as a result of direct tobacco use while 890 000 die because they were exposed to those who smoke. Up to 30% of boys start smoking before the age of 15.
