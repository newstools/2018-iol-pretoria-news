Ekangala - The case against Johannes Mokgatla, the step-grandfather accused of killing Nhlanhla Sibanyoni, 9, was postponed in the Ekangala Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The case was postponed to January 30 2019 for further investigation. The Grade 2 pupil's body was found in bushes three weeks ago. Nhlanhla was found face down by a cow herder. The boy could not be identified immediately owing to the extensive injuries to his face. Community members said it appeared the boy had been beaten in the face with a blunt object. On Wednesday angry community members filled the small courtroom to show support to the family of the slain child. They also held a short demonstration outside court subsequent to the proceedings. The 47-year-old suspect, who made his second court appearance, had lived with the boy’s family since 2014 up until the day of the tragedy.
