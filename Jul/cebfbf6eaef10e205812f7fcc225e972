THE police have cleared the crime scene in Pretoria central where five taxi drivers were shot and wounded following a route disputs between drivers from two associations. Two of the five wounded taxi drivers were rushed to intensive care at Steve Biko Academic hospital after the incident. Menlyn Taxi Association drivers blamed drivers from the Mamelodi Amalgamated Taxi Association (MATA). Mxolosi Rakgalakane, a representative of drivers from the Menlyn association, said MATA divers shot at their drivers because they had been in a dispute over the use of the route for years. He said they had to rush four of the wounded drivers to hospital in taxis. MATA spokesperson Bonny Ndjishe told the Pretoria News that he could not confirm nor deny if MATA drivers pulled the trigger as he was just briefed about the incident. He said there would be a meeting between executive committee members from the two associations today to find common ground. Committee members from the Menlyn association arrived at the scene early in the morning after hearing the news. They said they could not address the media but they would later communicate through their spokesperson. It remains to be seen if peace will be restored between the parties as they collect and drop-off passengers at the corner of Madiba and Sisulu Streets - where the shooting took place. Passengers Shilavi Malumbete and Koketso Montlana said they were shocked and scared when shots were fired. They ran for their lives and even missed work since the shooting took place when they get taxis to work. "I am worried and scared for my safety now. Where are we going to get taxis to work if they are shooting at each other? "Our lives are in danger. They must sort out their differences and leave us out of their disputes," The City has condemned the taxi violence.
