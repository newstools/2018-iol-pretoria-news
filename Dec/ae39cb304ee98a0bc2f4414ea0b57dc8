His 10-day exhibition opened on Thursday night with a live segment showing off his skills with the salt. The Salt Art of The Earth exhibition will be open for public viewing until Saturday. Entry is free. “Those who want to purchase artworks are also welcome,” the 33-year-old from Winterveldt said. Maimela added he had discovered his salt art technique while working as a merchandiser for retail stores. He quit his job in 2015 to pursue art as a full-time profession. “The Salt Art of The Earth exhibition is about realising the power of reinventing oneself and finding a way to be productive by using resources that has always been around us," he explained. “Mother Nature gave birth to opportunities, some of them are left behind in means of self-discovery like the journey of the rose growing out of concrete. "The reason why I use salt is to show that we can give meaning to something that was meant for only one purpose,” Maimela said. He drew his inspiration from the day-to-day issues in his community. His work received a lot of interest and was in demand from both the public and the private sector, Maimela said. “Salt company Marine Sea Salt, based in Port Elizabeth, spotted my work on the internet and so I’m in the process of being made brand ambassador to shine light on the PE salt products.” The exhibition is under the theatre’s Incubator Programme funded by the Department of Arts and Culture. The programme covers musical theatre, visual arts, music, poetry and dance. After they exit the incubation programme, artists across the genres enjoy much success in their chosen fields.
