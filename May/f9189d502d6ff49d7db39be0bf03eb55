ON Thursday Judge AJ Johnson sentenced convicted murderer Sandile Mantsoe to an effective 32-years in jail in the Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. The sentence was met with mixed reactions on Twitter, with some saying he deserved a life sentence instead while others praised judge Johnson for “a job well done.” Johnson found Mantsoe guilty of assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm; murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Mantsoe was accused of stabbing 22-year-old Mokoena, dumping her body in a veld and setting her alight in April 2017. But he denied killing her, claiming he found his former girlfriend dead in his upmarket Sandton apartment after she supposedly committed suicide. Mantsoe has admitted to disposing of Mokoena’s body. Judge Johnson described Mantsoe as the devil in disguise. “The court cannot describe you in any other way but as a devil in disguise.” “I am guessing you thought that your riches would get you everywhere but they got you nowhere‚” he added. He sentenced Mantsoe to 30 years for murder‚ a further five years for assault and four years for defeating the ends of justice‚ adding that he had given men a bad name.
