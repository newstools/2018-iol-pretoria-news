Pippa is a life-size fibreglass dairy cow. Pay a crown to have a turn at the milking stool, and if you can get enough into your bucket in 90 seconds, you could walk away with a one litre beer voucher! Something you could even try at home is the ancient art of Masskrugstemmen, better known in Biervaria as Mass Heben. This is an old Brauhaus game played worldwide: you stand with one arm behind your back and the other straight in front of you, parallel to the ground, holding one litre of delicious beer. Now, try not to drink it for as long as you can, keeping the arm straight out in front of you as a test of mental and physical fortitude. We have a 500ml category for the ladies. So make sure to put on your finest Lederhosen or Dirndl when you join us at Time Square on November 2-3. Make sure to secure your tickets on iTickets today.
