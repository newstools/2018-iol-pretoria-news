City manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola bade farewell to the pair yesterday at Tshwane House. “It is absolutely amazing that you have served us for more than 40 years. On behalf of the mayor and the people of the capital we want to thank you for your service. Your service will not go unnoticed. We will absolutely miss you,” he said. He applauded them for having set good examples for all City workers. “We do hope we can build the city going forward, and that as you are at home and read about us and see us on TV that you can be proud of what you have built,” he said. One of the employees, Lucy Ann Steenkamp, 65, started working at the municipality in 1981 as a typist. She worked under the defunct Pretoria City Council during the apartheid years, and was part of the establishment of the new megacity in 2000. “In my time I have seen unfairness, bias and arrogance. Now what I see are people who have a better attitude towards the employer. I have maintained a good attitude towards my employer," she said. “There is fairness now and there is no arrogance. I have experienced caring and lots of love,” she added. Steenkamp told the Pretoria News she would fondly remember the City as she prepares to go on pension this month. “I am officially the oldest person on the City’s payroll. I am going to miss the way the City responded when I needed them,” she said. Over the years, Steenkamp worked in the human resources department, and was involved in establishing an HIV information centre. Her colleague, Aaron Bodiba, started working at the City in 1989 as a driver. He said he would miss Mosola’s smile, which made him approachable. “I will miss him dearly. Mr Mosola told us that when we have problems we must not be reluctant to let him know about it. We must not talk about our problems to outsiders before he hears them. He is a good leader.”
