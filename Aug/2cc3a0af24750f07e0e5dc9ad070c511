THE newly proposed tobacco bill could collapse township businesses who trade tobacco products if implemented by parliament. President of the Concerned Tshwane Liquor Traders Association  Oupa Mthombeni  said Minister of Health Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi should reconsider the bill that will force customers to smoke at least 10 metres from taverns. He said townships were small and 10m was a big luxury most taverns do not have outside. He said most taverns already did not approve smoking inside unless they had a designated smoking area. “If a customer has to leave the tavern to smoke 10m away, by the time he or she reaches that distance, he will already be in my neighbour’s yard or smoking in the streets and in front of children.” he said. He said tavern owners were also in support of protecting the heath of people who do not smoke but that should not come at a price that could collapse small township businesses. Motsoaledi released the Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery System Bill for public comments in May. It has already received strong criticism from numerous organisations representing tobacco traders and farmers. These organisations against the bill argued that it would criminalise all business owners who already sell cigarette products. They said the bill would also be impossible to implement in townships. They advised government to toss aside the bill because “it would not be workable in South Africa since it was drafted without thorough considerations of consequences.”
