These were some of the sentiments expressed over the news yesterday that the cultural activist, acclaimed trumpeter and liberation Struggle veteran had died. Masekela lost his battle with prostate cancer. He had been receiving treatment for the disease since 2008. Not long afterwards, social media users took to different platforms to express their sadness, appreciate his music and also to crack jokes about some of the things he will be remembered for; dislike for the weaves and being the ambassador for funeral policy company Assupol. On Twitter @carlamackenzie7 said: “Your Sixty album came out when I was 10. We had a Djembe in our house and I would pretend I was part of your band. I met you 15 years after and it was everything I hoped it would be. Thank you for the music.” @mO_Moremi wrote: “Seems death continue taking from us. Anyway, even though the song has ended the melody still lingers on. RIP Bra Hugh; hope your seeds continue to blossom in the music industry.” Masekela caused a stir in 2015 at Rhodes University when he refused to take pictures with girls donning weaves or hair extensions, and yesterday the women  joked they were now free to put on any hairstyle of their choice. Sherly Zungu posted: “I am now free to put on my weave without with no worries.” They also made jokes about his Assupol advertisements with Papla Mankahla saying : “RIP Bra Hugh! A living legend A Giant. At least Assupol has you covered.” Juvenile Maimela Chatterbox said: “Hugh Masekela was advertising his death via #Assupol. What was he thinking?” Sandlana Luzamo said the public would not be asked for donations towards the funeral as with other fallen legends as Assupol had it covered. However, Facebook user Nate Bovungana reprimanded them saying the jokes were not necessary. “Guys these #Assupol lame jokes are unnecessary. Please stop seeking relevance in sad times, grow up.”
