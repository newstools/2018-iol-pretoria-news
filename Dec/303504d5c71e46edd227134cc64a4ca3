Pretoria - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has announced a 40-day closure of the Pretoria Station to bring it up to par and provide commuters with "decent and modern" public transport. Gauteng Metrorail spokesperson, Lilian Mofokeng, said the parastatal would be closing off the Pretoria Station as of today for a period of 40 days, with no trains accessing the station during this period. Mofokeng said refurbishments being rolled-out were part of Prasa’s modernisation programme. This will involve replacement of old signals, turnouts and points machines. She said the benefits of the new modernised infrastructure will give commuters safer, faster, smoother and world class train service and improve travelling times. Commuters have been advised to adhere to the service announcements to be made at stations during this period to familiarise themselves with the revised train timetable. Mofokeng said the final testing and commissioning of the newly installed electronic signalling system at the Park Station complex was going well. With a majority of the platforms running with the new system, something which Mofokeng said indicated that the transition from the old system to the new electronic interlocking system was a huge success. “We understand that this maybe a short term inconvenience but the commuters will benefit from infrastructure improvements in the long term.”
