They will be performing in Cape Town on May 15, at the Grand Arena, GrandWest; at the Durban ICC on May 17; and in Pretoria at the Sun Arena, Time Square, on May 19. The trio, Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey Virtue, have upheld the status of UB40 as Britain’s most successful reggae band of all time - a music pioneer outfit since 1978. They have been at the top of their game since reforming in 2013. They have also developed into a formidable touring outfit, performing their all-time classic hits Red Red Wine, Kingston and Can’t Help Falling in Love. They have also shown that they have no intention of stopping to churn out more hits as they released a critically acclaimed top 10 album in 2014, titled Silhouette. Their world tours have included visits to North and South America, Nigeria, Dubai, Europe and Papua New Guinea. “We’ve had an outstanding three years on the road,” said lead vocalist Campbell. “In America, we’re playing huge venues that we last visited 20 years ago. For me, it’s all about promoting reggae. “At the end of the day, fans don’t care about what goes on behind the scenes. “They only care about the music, and that’s what we’re giving them. “We’re having a great time and we’re doing it in style,” he said.
