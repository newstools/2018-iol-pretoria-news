Ngcobo, a final year student at Tshwane University of Technology had only been working as a Taxify driver for about a week when he was found burnt to death in the boot of his car. He was living with his aunt Nobuhle Mbonambi in Centurion at the time of his death but hailed from Ngoqokazi at Inanda near Durban where his funeral was held. Among those to attend the service, was KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Mxolisi Kaunda together with his Gauteng counterpart, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, who comforted his mother Zandile Mbonambi and other family members. A letter from Transport Minister Blade Nzimande was read out at the funeral. An aunt, Thembile Zwane, said Mbonambi had so many questions about why her son was killed and why in such an horrific way. Zwane said the family hoped arrests would be made soon. Chris Ravhuhali and a delegation representing Uber and Taxify drivers in Pretoria attended, and he called for government intervention in the taxi wars. Ravhuhali asked why Ngcobo’s death was not being prioritised, asking “how many such gatherings (funerals of taxi drivers) must we have?” Speaking to the taxi industry, Nkosi-Malobane urged: “Let us compete as business people and not with violence this must stop now, Siya should be the last person to die at the hands of the dogs of Gauteng.” - Staff Reporter
