Pretoria - The response to a call to observe a car-free day on Friday in Hatfield was relatively slow, said the City of Tshwane's acting divisional head of transport planning Emelda Matlawe. Matlawe spoke to journalists at an event organised by the City to encourage people to ditch their cars for alternative public transport. She said that in future the city would identify other areas to host the same event. For the better part of the day some sections of Burnett Street, between Grosvenor and Hilda Streets, were declared car-free zones. Hilda Street was fully operational in the north-south direction, with limited access from south to north due to the one-way system. MMC for Transport Sheila Senkubuge said the idea behind it was to encourage people to be less dependent on their private cars and try alternative modes of public transport like the Tshwane Bus Service, A Re Yeng, Metrorail, Gautrain and taxis. Senkubuge said: "It isn’t just the smog or the traffic deaths in the city, cars aren’t even a convenient way to get around and thus do not only impact drivers but business suffers too, daily production gets heavily bashed due to these inconveniences." The event was hosted for the second consecutive year in Hatfield to use the area as a case study. Senkubuge said: "As we all know we have more youth in our city than any other city in the country, most of them reside around here, because of the universities. "Public transport is more accessible around the Hatfield area, with A Re Yeng, TBS and Gautrain busses, minibus taxis, Gautrain and Metrorail trains around Hatfield."
