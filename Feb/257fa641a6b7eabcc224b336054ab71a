During that time, Ritchie edited the company’s smallest and largest daily newspapers - Kimberley’s Diamond Fields Advertiser and The Star of Joburg. Ritchie has yet to announce what his plans are. “Independent has been my professional home, in one guise or another, ever since I began my career in journalism in Kimberley in February 1991,” he said. “I’ve made incredible friends, had the privilege of working with and for industry legends and I leave only with happy memories and the best wishes for everyone at Independent.” Executive chairman Dr Iqbal Survé said Ritchie would be long remembered for his work ethic and loyalty to the company and its staff. “Please join us in thanking Kevin for his service to the company and wishing him success with his future plans,” he added.
