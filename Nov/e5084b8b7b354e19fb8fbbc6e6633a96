And justice is what the family will get, says advocate Gerrie Nel, head of the AfriForum private prosecution unit. He said they would be supporting the family against Ford Motor Company in the case. Jimmy burnt to death in December 2015 when the Ford Kuga he was driving caught alight while on holiday in the Wilderness in the Western Cape. The family said it had been engaged in a relentless battle to get answers from Ford since the tragedy. “The criminal justice system of South Africa failed the victim in this case. The family has been waiting for almost three years for the case to be investigated and AfriForum wrote letters imploring the magistrate’s court in George to hold a formal inquest,” said Nel. Since the tragedy more than 80 other Kugas caught fire resulting in the global motoring giant recalling 4000 cars. The National Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute Ford and denied the family a nolle prosequi (no longer prosecute) certificate because they were awaiting the result of the inquest. AfriForum said it monitored and assisted with the process leading up to the announcement of a formal inquest to be held before a Judge of the High Court, which starts on February 4, 2019. Nel said that it was unacceptable that “international corporate bullies like Ford” regarded themselves as above the law. “We were astonished that Ford ceased all communication with the victims and, during discussions, made statements implying it had deep pockets.” Jimmy’s sister Renisha said the family felt Ford led them into thinking the matter would finally be settled, only to hear the company now contending he was shot. During the process there were also rumours that he committed suicide by shooting himself.
