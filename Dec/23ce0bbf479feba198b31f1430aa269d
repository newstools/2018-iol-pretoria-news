Pretoria - A time where we can go through the festive season without having to count up the dead bodies in the aftermath is what we want. That was what Tshwane mayor, Solly Msimanga and Tshwane Metro Police Department, Lieutenant-General Johanna Nkomo, said they hoped to witness in their lifetimes. And until such a time where every single pedestrian and motorist in every community took responsibility for their actions, emergency services and road stakeholders would continue to do their bit. Msimanga and Nkomo, were speaking at the launch of the city’s 2018 road safety operation at the Centurion Licensing centre along Nellmapius drive. With the festive season literally around the corner, the launch serves to indicate the various law enforcement agencies commitment to intensify operations during this period.

Msimanga said emergency officials had to be on high alert 24/7during this period because road safety and crime prevention continued to be an issue of concern particularly during the festive season. He cautioned motorists to abide by the road rules and regulations, but also to be extra mindful of pedestrians. “Road safety, as it is often said, is everybody’s responsibility. And all of us can trust that the emergency services departments will continue to create an environment that makes it possible for everyone to contribute to reducing and ultimately eliminating road fatalities.” Nkomo added that the police services would be adopting a zero-tolerance to law breakers, increasing visibility to ensure those travelling home and those remaining behind can be safe.
