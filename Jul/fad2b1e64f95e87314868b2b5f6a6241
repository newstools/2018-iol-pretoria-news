THE first-ever township film academy in Gauteng; Leaders in Motion Academy launched today will afford students an opportunity to break into the film industry and allow them to tell their own stories. The academy situated at the South African Creative Industries Incubator in Eersterust aims to benefit young people from financially disadvantaged backgrounds within the Tshwane municipality. Selected youth will be given an opportunity to gain valuable work experience through a well-crafted, accredited, fully funded theoretical and practical film course. The course is mainly targeted at aspiring township film makers, and the academy aims to benefit young people from financially disadvantaged backgrounds within the Tshwane municipality. During the 12-month programme, participants will receive tuition in accredited film and video production theory and practical instruction on productions, with access to industry professionals. The academy also accommodates all students who are physically challenged. Students will be shuttled to and from the academy. Daily meals, at no cost to the student, will be provided while in attendance. The first intake of 100 students will be in September. To date, at least nine candidates have been selected.

Actor and founder Thato Molamu who has hung up his actor hat for the time being to focus on the Academy said: “We want to curb township social ills by giving talented young film entrepreneurs with creative minds the skills, resources and funding they need to succeed. My reason for partnering with the South African Creative Incubator is because I simply love the idea of creating a township film economy,” he said.
