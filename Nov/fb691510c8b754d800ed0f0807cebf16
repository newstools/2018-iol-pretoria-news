DURBAN - Blythedale Coastal Estate is a R16 billion development located at the heart of KwaDukuza. This thousand hectares coastal estate is nestled between Durban and Richards Bay and is only a 30-minute drive from the King Shaka Airport. The estate will house retirement villas, home units, apartments, world-class water parks and three hotel offerings. The resort has access to 3km of the coastline as well as the 320 hectares of coastal indigenous forest. Andrew Thompson, sales director of the eLan Property Group said, "As the resort development moves into full swing, there will be expansion in a number of areas including massive effort to improve job creation, skills development, education opportunities and growth in tourism". The development will have an economic impact on the KwaZulu-Natal province with the Blythedale Coastal Estate being both a tourist and entertainment attraction. Blythedale will also be a key driver of employment with the development creating 10 000 permanent jobs and 110 000 construction jobs. According to the property group, the infrastructure for the development will take eight years. Construction has already started while the full infrastructure will commence February 2019. At the KZN Investment Seminar that was held at the beginning of October, Blythedale was included in a booklet about potential investment opportunities. “Blythedale Coastal Resort is lovely. It’s the perfect place to relax,” says Sharon Pitham, a potential investor.
