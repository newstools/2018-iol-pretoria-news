The dogs belonged to the couple, both aged 70, but were left homeless after the couple were evicted last Monday. The Miniature Pinscher is a small breed of dog originating from Germany. Experts suspect that the breed’s earliest ancestors may have included the German Pinscher mixed with Italian greyhounds and dachshunds. Woodrock Animal Rescue co-founder Stella Meldau said when they learnt how many dogs needed a home, their initial response was “no; we are seriously full”. She said they did not understand why the couple did not sterilise their pets. However, Meldau soon found out that the 22 pets belonged to an elderly couple who visibly showed that they truly cared for and loved the dogs. “On our arrival at the place we found that all the dogs were in reasonable condition except for two. One had been in fight and required urgent medical attention and the other had a severe eye infection. Other than that, the couple proved to have loved the dogs as they were all lovingly named, they slept indoors and were fed and hydrated,” she said. Meldau called on animal lovers to assist in any way they could to get the dogs adopted.
