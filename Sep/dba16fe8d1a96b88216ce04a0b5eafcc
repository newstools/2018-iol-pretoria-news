Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha said the government of the Republic of Angola had formally requested the government of the Republic of South Africa for assistance in exhuming and repatriating the remains. Circumstances at the time of his death conspired against the transfer of his mortal remains to Angola, Masutha said at the special repatriation ceremony at Air Force Base Waterkloof. He said the recovery and exhumation of the remains of Pena was a result of joint efforts by South Africa and Angola, the two countries that emerged from difficult political conflicts that cost many lives. “Both countries continue to seek ways through which to recover from those conflicts and to build reconciliation and national unity. “The recovery of the remains of those who perished in the conflicts and their return to their families for proper burial is an important step towards this national reconciliation and unity,” Masutha said. The minister said South Africa was pleased to have played a role in assisting the Angolan government in the recovery, exhumation and repatriation in line with the country's commitment to the principle of international solidarity. The repatriation of Pena's remains was overseen by the Presidency, with the Department of Justice as the implementing arm. The physical recovery of Pena's remains was conducted jointly by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Unit in the department and Missing Persons Task Team in the National Prosecuting Authority.
