Duarte said this after a media briefing at Luthuli House. EWN reporter Clement Manyathela spoke to Duarte after the briefing to get clarity on what she said about ANC NEC member Tony Yengeni to the Sunday Times. Manyathela said Duarte was happy to speak. However, a few minutes later she made an about-turn, instructing him not to use the recording simply because he was from 702. “If you were working for Africa World View I would have a different view because 702 is owned by people who have historically hated the ANC,” she said. Duarte went on to talk about 702 presenter Eusebius McKaiser and how 702 presenters had come to a conclusion about who was and who wasn’t corrupt. 702 was a noted hater of anyone who was progressive, she said. Duarte said she would not allow Manyathela to use the recording. EWN confirmed that they would not broadcast an audio recording without the permission of the person interviewed. The secretary-general of the South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef), Moipone Malefane, said Sanef condemned any kind of attack on journalists. “I think Ms Duarte should have answered the question instead of abusing the journalist,” she said.
