Dubbed the “The Happiest 5K on the Planet” the run has been experienced by over 6 million runners worldwide in over 35 countries, and remains a leader in the fun running space. It was founded in 2011 to bring people together to make the world a happier, healthier place. This year’s theme brings with it stilt-walkers, balloon-shapers, music, good-natured clowning around and more colour. Each Color Runner will also receive a limited-edition Carnival race shirt, headband, powder pack and fun temporary tattoos. And for the first time, The Carnival Tour will be handing out exclusive Color Run finishers medals. “It doesn’t matter if it’s your first experience with The Colour Run or if you’ve been joining in for years, the Carnival Tour will be the most memorable 5km of your life,” they said, adding: “You don’t have to head to New Orleans or Rio de Janeiro, because on Saturday you get to live your life in bold colour.” Residents of the city and beyond are invited to be there to revel in health, happiness and the community in an atmosphere of pure celebration as they take part, which is, however, more about having the time of their life. Participants will begin the race in their white Color Run T-shirts, and complete it covered in colour. This year The Carnival Tour theme brings with it memorable moments.
