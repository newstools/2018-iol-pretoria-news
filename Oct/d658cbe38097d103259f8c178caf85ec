Football coaches in Mamelodi are one step closer to making their life-long dreams a reality. From about midday 30 aspiring coaches from the Mamelodi LFA underwent the first day of a week-long Safa D Licence coaching course which is aimed at upskilling them into qualified and accredited coaches. The course which involves theory and practical is taking place at the Mamelodi Central Sports Ground next to HM Pitje Stadium. The initiative sponsored by Betway South Africa is also aimed at leaving a lasting legacy in local football. The course will touch on the latest theoretical and practical coaching methods. This will also include the use of technology in modern football.   Betway will, for the next five days, work closely with the LFA to afford the coaches an opportunity to get upskilled and empower them to plough back into their respective communities.    The Safa D Licence coaching certificate, which is an entry level to professional coaching, will assist in improving the coaches’ abilities as well as contributing to positively building on the standard of football in the township of Mamelodi – which has produced star players such as Mamelodi Sundowns player, George Lebese and Thulasizwe Mbuyane.   Speaking at the opening of day of the course in Mamelodi, Betway’s Marketing Director, Mark Rowles said this was a “no brainer”. “We are passionate about sport and believe it brings communities together. "So what better way to illustrate that than ploughing back into the community,” he said. Also assisting at the coaching clinic is SA U20 assistant coach and former Bafana Bafana player, Helman Mkhalele. He was joined by Mameluke Sundowns’ development side coach Joel "Fire" Masilela. Mkhalele said: “We all know that the township has raw talent in football. Our jobs with these couching clinics is to nurture it.” Asked about the unconvincing national squad, Bafana Bafana, Mkhalele said: “They need to work on their psychological self. Believe more in themselves.”
