TSHWANE residents will experience water interruptions today as the City plans embarks on rescheduled maintenance and the upgrade of pipes sourcing water from the Pierre van Ryneveld reservoir. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo issued an apology to residents for possible inconvenience as the work could see various residential areas without water between 7am and 8pm. The initial work was scheduled for October 16 but had to be postponed due to unforeseen complications encountered upon commencement of work on site. Mashigo said routine maintenance and upgrading work meant that technicians were tasked with lessening unplanned maintenance, limiting possible pipe bursts, improve water supply to some areas. This work included the reduction of constant major repairs that result in water interruption, and reducing the number of areas affected by burst pipes. The City said special areas that could be affected included Irene Village Mall, Amasondo Tyres, Aerosud, Prius Battery Fix, Aapstertjies Kleuterskool/Creche, Kirkness Pharmacy, Henning C M Total. Others areas mentioned were Pierre van Ryneveld, Farm City, Mini-Monkeys Playgroup/Speelgroep, Paragon Accounting Software Solutions, Shopping Centre on corner of Fouche Road and Van Ryneveld Avenue and Rapha Designs
