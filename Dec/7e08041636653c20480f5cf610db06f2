This was according to those who participated in the workshop titled We Are for Women, hosted by the Embassy of the United States and Dads in the Picture. They gathered at the Es’kia Mphahlele Community Library in the event that coincided with the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children. “Culture has unconsciously given men the visa to walk away from their families because some cultures say a child belongs to the mother. “Due to this, young men who grow up without a father in their lives have anger which may not be towards an individual, but society in general,” said Meshack Kekana, founder of Dads in the Picture. Kekana said he often heard young men vow that they would grow up to become the best fathers, better than their fathers. “But I argue that you can never be better than your father if you don’t know him,” he said. He told the men gathered that they needed to start playing their part in raising young men at home and not on the streets. He said that if together they vowed to stop violence against women, the issue could be solved in the next three generations. “We will (then) have 0% gender-based violence and I am saying this will take three generations because we will not win this battle by one generation. The current generation needs all the support they can get so that the third generation stands a chance to win the battle.” Speaking to the Pretoria News on the sidelines of the event, Kekana said good fathers constituted about 20% of fathers in the country. He said the number of good fathers was overshadowed by absent fathers. Assistant cultural attaché at the embassy Kiera Emmons said the workshop was part of their observing 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children.
