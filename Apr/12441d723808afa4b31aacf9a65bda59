JAMES MAHLOKWANE The National Prosecuting Authority provisionally withdraw charges against former head of the police crime intelligence service in the Free State, Agnes Makhele, accused of aiding former Acting Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Kgomotso Phahlane, in dodging corruption investigations by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). Prosecutor Tumi Phongola-Nkosi told the Pretoria Magistrate's Court that the state decided to withdraw charges of defeating the ends of justice and contravening section 33 of the Ipid Act this morning. Makhele was arrested and attending court in the capital for leading a Free Stage team that shielded the controversial Phahlane from Ipid investigations. Phahlane was investigated for allegedly acquiring an expensive R80 000 sound system as kickback for questionable dealings. His luxurious house and fleet of cars were also questioned as he and his wife were career police officers and could not afford them from their salaries. Phahlane appointed Makhele to the position of head of the police crime intelligence service in the Free State. Some people believed that explained her alleged loyalty to Phahlane. The Ipid stated in affidavits that Makhele and provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane had established a team in the North West to interfere with witnesses under false pretences that Phahlaneâ€™s life was in danger; only to aid him to avoid investigations. Prior to the charges being withdrawn, Makhele and her representatives were in the process of seeking an information technology expert to help them view CCTV footage that would be used as evidence against her by the state. Ipid Spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the footage exposed Makhele secretly gesturing her subordinate, Colonel Collen Trollope, not to co-operate with an Ipid investigator
