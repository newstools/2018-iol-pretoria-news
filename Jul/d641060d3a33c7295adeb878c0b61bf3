Masandawana, the Premier Soccer League champions, unveiled the kit yesterday. Kit suppliers Puma said the new jersey “leverages the personality of the team and their roots in Mamelodi”. The traditional Brazil yellow is still there, but is supplemented by an “M” that also symbolises what Puma describe as the “heartbeat” of the players and fans. The blue shorts and white socks have been retained. “The campaign talks to the singing and dancing, a trademark of the team and the players, but it also connects everyone through their daily hustle as they live and work in South Africa and prepare for each Sundowns football match,” said Puma South Africa marketing director Brett Bellinger. “The beat can be represented in a heartbeat - the fans and the team beating as one - and this is symbolised by a subtle M (for Mamelodi) heartbeat, which pulses across the front of the shirts.” The away jersey is mainly white, with yellow and green sleeves, with white shorts and socks. Oupa Manyisa and Themba Zwane modelled the new jerseys, and Sundowns spokesperson Thulani Thuswa said: “This is definitely a jersey fit for a club as ambitious and progressive as Mamelodi Sundowns. “The evoKNIT technology featured in the new jerseys is ahead of its time. "Puma once again leads the market with unique designs. “In the 2018/19 season ,the boys will step out in style as we seek to stamp our authority on the local and continental scenes once again. “We will also have even more fan gear on offer, and our card-carrying members will still enjoy a 20% discount.” Puma said that there were cooling zones in the shirt that helped to regulate the body’s temperature. In addition, the dryCELL technology helped deal with moisture using high-performance yarns. The company added that the jersey had a lightweight “second skin” feel. The new kit will be available from today at R799 at all leading sports goods retailers.
