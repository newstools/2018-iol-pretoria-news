Pretoria - It was a buzz of activity at Sun Internationalâ€™s Time Square in Pretoria on Wednesday as Social Development minister Susan Shabangu and other dignitaries, with the help the public, packed food parcels to distribute to the Early Childhood Development Centres, among others in Pretoria. Children in need aged between two and five at these centres across the country will be provided with these meals. This was done as part of the 67 minutes to commemorate the birthday of Nelson Mandela. Sun International aimed at providing 10 million meals to these centres and the ingredients were packed at different Sun International locations across the country. In Pretoria, Shabangu rolled up her sleeves and packed rice and other staple ingredients, which be used to make up meals for these children as part of the Rise Against Hunger project. She said it was very important to be part of changing the lives of children. Shabangu said it should not be a one day event, but people should continuously work towards bettering the lives of children. "Changing the lives of children is changing the future," she said. The Ambassadors of Switzerland and the Netherlands, together with their staff, also provided a helping hand.  zelda.venter@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
