DURBAN – Taxify has launched a loyalty programme for South African drivers that will allow them to obtain life, disability and medical insurance, at no cost to them. The loyalty programme works by allocating 25c for every litre of fuel that Taxify drivers purchase at Shell petrol stations to a virtual wallet. The allocated money will then be used to secure a wide range of insurance benefits. The insurance product that the Taxify drivers will benefit from is called TSure and it is being offered by Expanded Risk Portfolio Managers. These benefits include insurance for medical expenses, evacuation, disability, in-hospital cash and accidental death up to a maximum of R50 000. The benefits that the insurance offers is not limited to when they are driving or carrying passengers and are available on a 24/7 basis. “The safety of our drivers and riders is our foremost priority and is a responsibility that we take very seriously,” says Gareth Taylor, country manager for Taxify in South Africa. The loyalty programme is also developed to help drivers boost their profitability as drivers can withdraw and spend the remaining money in their virtual wallet at the end of the month on fuel or other vehicle expenses to help reduce their business costs, or to supplement their earnings. This is in addition to the increase in fares in June of this year that Taxify implemented in response to the significant negative impact of recent petrol price increases on drivers’ earnings and profitability. “The price of South African petrol has increased by more than 24% since March this year and we estimate that it is now drivers’ single biggest expense at approximately 25 percent of their monthly turnover,” says Taylor.
