The 14-year-old Conradie (Tuks) was brilliant at the championships, winning two gold medals, a silver medal and bronze to finish second overall in the junior category. More importantly, she qualified for the Olympic Youth Games in Buenos Aires (October 6-18). Coach Louis Fourie says he is impressed by how Conradie seems to be able to handle pressure when competing. “Lisa is something special. When she walks out to perform her routine, no matter which apparatus, I can’t help admiring her talent.” Maguire, who is studying BCom Accounting at Tuks, was third overall in the senior competition during the African Championships. For now, she is satisfied with her performance. She admits she has to tweak a few small things in her technique for the various apparatus before competing in Japan. “In gymnastics you are forever able to shift the boundaries. There are no half-measures. You are either doing it right or wrong. An amazing thing about the sport is that you get to learn that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I'm constantly surprised what the human body is capable of,” said Maguire who trains up to three hours six days a week. - African News Agency (ANA)
