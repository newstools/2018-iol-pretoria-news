The Pretoria-based franchise has been on the hunt for a successor for John Mitchell ever since the former coach left the Bulls to join the England management team earlier this year. It was recently confirmed that Matfield was one of the shortlisted candidates along with Kings coach Deon Davids and Blue Bulls Currie Cup coach Pote Human. It’s believed Matfield will soon be confirmed as Mitchell’s official replacement. Also, Alan Zondagh is set to become the Bulls’ director of rugby to work alongside Matfield as the union looks to undergo a restructuring process. It was reported the Blue Bulls Company has been able to report a R2million profit this year thanks to the £200000 (R3.48m) it received from the England RFU to buy Mitchell out of his contract. The Bulls also last week named Alfonso Carl Meyer as the new chief executive officer to replace Barend van Graan. The Bulls confirmed they were “in the final stages of appointing a head coach and would make an announcement during the course of next (this) week”. African News Agency (ANA)
