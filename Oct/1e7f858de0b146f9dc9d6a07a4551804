Today is World Handbag Day, and women in the city chuckled and were surprised at the idea that their beloved handbags, which made carrying all their necessities around with them easier, could have that much bacteria. This was discovered by a study by Initial Washroom Hygiene, which noted how as many as 10000 bacteria could be on and in a woman’s handbag. The study found that while a woman’s handbag contains many of the essentials she needs to meet the demands of her world, it also contains more bacteria than an average toilet seat. According to studies, the handbags are also one of the worst germ hot spots in a typical household. Helen Phushela said she was aware that cellphones carried a lot of germs and bacteria because they were constantly in use, but she didn’t think handbags could be just as hazardous. “I think the reason they would have so much bacteria is because we literally live in our bags. You can sneak in anything from food to clothes, make-up or even sanitary stuff; it’s our go-to shelf on the go.” Itumeleng Mogale from Mabopane was just as shocked to hear news that a bag could possibly carry that much bacteria. “How is that even possible? Like, what could cause it to have that much germs? It is possible, because honestly I just don’t have time to be cleaning out my bag every day.” Modiegi Nyathi said although she was also surprised by the news, if food or make-up spilled in her bag she would clean it up, but normally she just emptied out whatever was inside.
