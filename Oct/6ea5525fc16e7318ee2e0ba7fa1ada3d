INTERNATIONAL – Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said a new chip that improves autopilot features would be available in about six months in all of the company’s new production electric cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving." Musk also tweeted that the new chip would improve the performance of Tesla’s Autopilot between 500 percent and 2000 percent. He said the installation of the chip would be priced at $5 000 (about R71 000) for those who did not order full self-driving. Tesla’s autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel. Tesla says drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times when using the system. Recently, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the company would possibly venture into making its own brand of tequila. Musk also posted a mock-up of roughly what the tequila bottle will look like. The phrase originated as an April Fools’ prank in which Musk tweeted that Tesla was going bankrupt. He posted jokingly that he had been “found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ‘Teslaquila’ bottles.” Reuters
