President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced numerous changes to Cabinet and Twitter is abuzz. As people awaited Ramaphosa's announcement, they took to Twitter to predict who would be axed and who would get to keep their positions. And just like they had predicted, Minister of Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini still remains in her position. People quickly took to Twitter to share memes, saying the minister was untouchable. The Presidency had earlier said :"These changes have been occasioned by the passing away in September 2018 of the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa, and the more recent resignation of the Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba." This is Ramaphosa's first Cabinet reshuffle since taking office in February. Ramaphosa said the new Minister of Environmental Affairs will be Nomvula Mokonyane and Siyabonga Cwele will be the new Minister of Home Affairs.
