The summit is attended by delegates from various civil society organisations, including traditional leaders and faith-based organisations. The summit is convened by the government following a series of marches against gender-based violence by formations such as the 100 Men March and #TotalShutdown, with the latter demanding Ramaphosa convene a summit. Ramaphosa is expected to respond to a number of demands which were delivered during a #TotalShutdown march in August. Participants of the march presented a set of 24 demands to Ramaphosa, one of which was that he convene a gender-based violence summit. Grizelda Grootboom, a survivor of human trafficking, also shared her story of how she was sold into the sex industry at the age of 18. Another survivor shared a story of how she ended up in a wheelchair after being stabbed by her ex-husband. Pretoria News
