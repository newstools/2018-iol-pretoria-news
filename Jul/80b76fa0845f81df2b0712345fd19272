JUST like the World Choir Games' motto "various voices, one harmony", that is the ambiance at the World Choir Village today. The village is abuzz with people from different countries, enjoying some local food and viewing some crafts while performers take centre stage and show off their talent. Artists make even the simplest popular songs sound like you've never heard them before. With broad smiles on their faces, the Kearsney College boys choir from KwaZulu-Natal sang "shosholoza" with such jovial mood. One of the boys in the group, Siyabonga Khumalo said they were singing for fun and just to show their competitors what they were made of. The dancing was just the cherry on top.
