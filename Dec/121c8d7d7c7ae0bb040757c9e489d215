Johannes Mokgatla, the step-grandad of a Grade 2 pupil from Sikhulisile Primary School who was found dead in the bushes appeared in the  Ekangala Magistrate’s Court in connection with the boy’s murder. The case has been postponed to Wednesday for bail application and he will remain in custody. The accused was arrested last week Thursday in KwaMhlanga, not too far from where the boy resided. Nhlanhla Sibanyoni, 9, was found face down by a cow herder three weeks ago. He could not be identified immediately due to the extensive injuries to his face. Community members said it appeared he had been beaten in the face with a blunt object. The 47-year-old man had lived with the boy’s family since 2014 until the day of the tragedy. Thobile Sibanyoni, the boy’s mother who spoke to the Pretoria News outside court subsequent to the proceedings, said the family was failing to come to terms with Nhlanhla’s death. She had previously said Mokgatla on the morning of the tragedy left a note threatening that he would murder the boy. In the note, which has since been taken by police, it was stated: “Nhlanhla and I are dead and I have enough pills to kill the both of us". Sibanyoni said she had had a misunderstanding with the suspect the previous night over cellphone airtime. Community members who had earlier filled the small courtroom to capacity have vowed to support the family until the end. They are expected to demonstrate outside the court when the accused makes his second appearance.
