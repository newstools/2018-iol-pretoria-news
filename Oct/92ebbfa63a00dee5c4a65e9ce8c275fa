Then in Pretoria, it emerged that the Civitas Building, home of the Department of Heath, was not in better condition either. That matter has been to the Labour Court and back to the city, and remain unresolved. Next up, Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga shut down Poyntons, occupied by the Department of Correctional Services, saying it was not safe. The building ills have since been resolved. Then most recently (as reported on the front page of todayâ€™s edition) the doctors' quarters at Dr George Mukhari Hospital caught fire. What is common about these buildings is that they all house government departments and entities. And in each case, staff say the buildings had previously been reported to management as being unsafe. The government really needs to start looking after its buildings soon before more tragedies unfold.
