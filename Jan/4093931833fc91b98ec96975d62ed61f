“We ran a little bit longer, but when Usain says he wants to play, who are we to say he can’t,” Puma SA marketing manager,Brett Bellinger joked after the session that left the sprinting legend feeling happy but out of shape. Bolt hasn’t competed since ending his stellar career in excruciating pain after he got injured in the 4x100m relay in London last year at the World Athletics Championships. He has put that in the past just as he did his running career - now the Jamaican aims to impress German side Borussia Dortmund to earn a contract after his trials with them in March. The Brazilians gave Bolt a good workout in a session he finished with a goal. But there was no over-the-top celebration as was the norm with every win on the athletic track. Bolt, however, will be borrowing something from his track and field career to help him in football. “They (Sundowns) were pretty good,” Bolt said. “It was a good experience. I don’t know how quick I am with the ball but if I kick and run, I can get there (and be a good player). It was a good game. It was a fun day and they were welcoming. Coach (Pitso Mosimane) told me that when I go back to Jamaica I need training. I'm very, very unfit.” Mosimane paid the sprinting legend a glowing tribute. “We respect you for what you have done and contributed not only to athletics but the world,” Mosimane said. “You gave hope and inspired millions. It’s only fitting for us to welcome you and make you feel special because you are special.” See Sport
