DURBAN – Google Maps has made two updates to make it easier for people to keep up with the places that they care about and find out about places coming soon according to their news blog. Users of Google Maps on Android devices can now follow places right from the app. People can search for that coffee shop you love or that clothing store you’ve been meaning to pop into and tap the “Follow” button. After the user has followed places, news from them—like events, offers and other updates—will appear in the For you tab which is available in certain places but coming soon to many countries. For people that want to be in the know about all the new places opening around town, they start seeing profiles for places before they even open on Google Maps for Android and mobile search—just look for the opening date in orange. Places that are opening soon can create a free Business Profile that will appear to people up to 3 months before their opening. This will allow trendsetters to know ahead of time and to mark their calendars. The new feature is rolling out over the next few weeks and places interested in making sure their coming soon locations are shown on Maps and Search can get started with Google My Business.
