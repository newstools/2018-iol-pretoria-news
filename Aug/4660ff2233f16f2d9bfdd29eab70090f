Leshabane was among the graduates who took to the streets of Pretoria to sell vegetables in order to raise money for travelling to interviews. Leshabane said sitting at home would not assist him in any way, and urged graduates to stand up. “Applying for jobs is never enough. It is up to us to find the solutions on how to rescue ourselves,” he said. “If you continue to sit at home you will end up being depressed and frustrating your family. This is a societal challenge. This message is consciousness to those that graduated and those who are still to graduate. “They need to know they have a responsibility to change this country. Employment is not just going to be handed to them.” Leshabane said unemployment was frustrating, especially for those who used the National Students Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). “If we used NSFAS to study and thereafter go back home to sit and do nothing, it frustrates us to a point where our families don’t know what we should do as we continue to study.” Nsizwa Nhlapo has a BTech in sport management and is enrolled for a Masters in entrepreneurship. He has been unemployed since 2016. “There’s nothing depressing like being unemployed. When you graduate, at home they have the expectations that you are going to improve their lives. It is a pity because many families think we are just too lazy to find jobs. “By raising money we wanted to demonstrate that we are not lazy, but there are no job opportunities for all of us. I have an international certificate, but I remain unemployed,” he said. University of Johannesburg graduate Walter Mashilo said he attended the fundraising campaign to lend moral support. “I relate with their struggle because I was once unemployed. We came out to encourage other unemployed graduates to tell them we do not need to wait for the government to employ us," he said.
