Pretoria - Health MMC Sakkie du Plooy has declared a war against hunger during the launch of a feeding scheme initiative called Food Bank at Tshwane Fresh Produce Market. He said the launch marked the beginning of a fight against hunger in at least 200 000 poor households in the City of Tshwane. Du Plooy said farmers have expressed their willingness to donate vegetables and fruit to Food Bank farmers. He said the city will distribute donations to non-profit organisations looking after destitute communities. "We are doing this because we realised that there is a lot of food that farmers don't use and they discard it. In our City there are 200 000 households, who are hungry. We have decided that from the Food Bank we will take vegetables and fruit that are available and pass them on to hungry people," he said.

Du Plooy said the City will keep track of the project's progress to assess its performance for the next three months. "There are no set expectations regarding the number of veggies and fruit we are likely to receive every week. We will give as and when we have something available. "Perhaps in the next three months we will have an idea about where the project is going," he said. He said the success of the project will depend on how the city continues to build its relationship with farmers. "There is tons of food that is thrown away from this market every year. It is discarded if it are not selling. Some food is discarded 200m from here," he said. He said many farmersÂ  have expressed their willingness to donate food to the poor. "What is happening today is really a sample. Those who will be receiving vegetables have been asking me for months. "This is the beginning and not the end," he said
