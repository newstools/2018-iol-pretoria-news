Pretoria - Can you imagine a life where going barefoot wasn’t an option, it was the only way?

Pupils donated plastic bags full of winter clothes which more than 8 000 families will benefit from. Half of the sports field was covered in bags full of clothes and non-perishable goods. After collection, Helpende Hand's staff and Lindie Strydom from Groot FM will already deal with poor families and donations to help against winter. Other schools will participate in the next few weeks and the project lasts more than six weeks during which the public can make donations. Mariana Kriel from Solidarity said the barefoot idea was to demonstrate what most homeless people go through every winter. “The fortunate have a duty to lend a helping hand,” she said. Pretoria News
