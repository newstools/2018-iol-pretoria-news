The three-day programme of events is brimming with things to do and see for everyone from pre-schoolers to book lovers, including a vault of books with industry experts showcasing books that entertain, educate, empower, inform and advance. The South African Library for the Blind will also showcase tactile books, promoting a positive reading experience for the blind and visually impaired. Celebrating #OurStories on the page, mic and stage, the 2018 Book Fair also promises a feast for lovers of the spoken word as the late Professor Keorapetse Kgositsile, affectionately known as Bra Willie, will be celebrated at the inaugural Keorapetse Kgositsile Poetry Café. The Book Fair, as part of the National Book Week campaign which runs throughout the country from September 3-9, starts with an exciting Schools Programme, where learners, librarians, teachers, caregivers and parents will be treated to storytelling in the vernacular, as well as a host of activities such as The Little Prince and other theatre productions, in The National Book Week Magic Tent. The literary programme takes place on Saturday and Sunday with an exciting line-up - from panel discussions to a Philosophy Café, facilitated by prominent thought leaders, and sessions dealing with some of the most pressing social, economic and political issues facing SA today. Experts from the publishing industry will be on hand to assist with learning and support materials, the best research and non-fiction books from the university presses and SMME publishers from all provinces.
