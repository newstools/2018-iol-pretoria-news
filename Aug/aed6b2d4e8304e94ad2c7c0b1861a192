Soshanguve and Mamelodi drug addicts who were turned away from a Cullinan rehabilitation centre are getting help from the Department of Social Development, said spokesperson Mbangwa Xaba. Nearly 80 addicts made a decision to kick the habit after various activists and church leaders took part in an awareness anti-nyaope long walk from Sandton to Soshanguve and Mamelodi. However, management at Dr Fabian and Florence Ribeiro Treatment Centre were not impressed with addicts trying to get themselves admitted to the centre unannounced during the weekend. The department explained that the police were called to disperse the crowd because the addicts had begun to act aggressive in their attempt to be admitted. Xaba said he was proud to announce that social workers and activists worked tirelessly to find 38 of the 39 addicts a place after they left their contact details at the centre before things got out of hand on July 28. He said social workers spent the last two weeks verifying the information provided by the addicts and establishing if they would have support structures when they start to recover. He said protocol had to be followed when seeking admission because it enabled social workers to identify or build, from scratch, a family support structure for every addict. People who abused substances were encouraged to make use of the department's rehabilitation centres but do so within protocol. He said unannounced walk-ins would be welcomed.
