Following a week of protests, the leaders were ordered to ensure compliance with the court order. If they fail to do this, they will have to give reasons to the court why they should not be held in contempt of the order. Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela said the university had obtained an interdict on Friday in the high court in Pretoria. “The interdict was duly served on all affected parties and is currently in force,” he said. The protest that ensued last week did not take place at any of their service centres where registration or the core academic activities took place. Ramotshela said the employees who were protesting belonged to agencies rendering services to Unisa. Their services came to an end last month. But the workers who assembled at the Sunnyside Campus yesterday said they were not going to take the interdict lying down. Manqoba Malange said they would continue to fight for their work. “We will continue peaceful protests at the Sunnyside campuses. Our presence needs to be felt.”
