Sonja Carstens, spokesperson for the United National Transport Union, sounded the alarm about the safety of train drivers during a media briefing in Centurion yesterday. She said drivers were vulnerable to commuters, who attack them because of train delays. “The ripple effect is that the drivers are increasingly traumatised.” She said drivers said the Pretoria to Johannesburg route was dangerous, but didn’t have figures as to how often drivers tendered their resignations. However, Carstens said there were at least one or two incidents of hijackings or robberies reported every week. She attributed the attacks and hijackings to acts of criminality, which were on the increase on trains managed by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). “It is obviously criminals targeting railway lines because it is a soft target and you won’t see police and security there,” she said. Carstens called on Prasa and SAPS to ensure there was security on trains to prevent robberies and hijackings. “The police are saying they are not responsible for the railway lines, but you will never find the same situation happening at the airports. You will never be able to torch the airplane,” she said. She said Prasa had cried out poverty, saying they had no money to put in place security measures. “Prasa is sitting on a time bomb; it is a ticking time bomb because it is just a matter of time until we see more trains derailed in serious accidents,” she said. She said commuters didn’t deem the train service to be reliable anymore as a result of the criminal acts.
