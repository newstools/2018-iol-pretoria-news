This group of workers were led by The National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nahawu) and Public Servants Association of South Africa (Psa) to voice out their plight and frustrations. Department spokesperson Popo Maja said it was not all the workers who are on strike and work was being done at the department by those who reported for duty. Challenges in the popular green and white building include a leaking roof, falling ceilings, dysfunctional air conditioners and elevators to mention a few. The unions said a damning report revealed that the building complied with pnly 20% of work environment requirements.

The department announce on Monday that it was working with the Department of Public Works to identify another building where the 1200 workers would be moved to. The move would only be temporary while construction workers repair all the problems identified by engineers and inspectors from public works. The workers are waiting in numbers to hear from Health Minister Aron Motsoaledi who is said to already be in the building. The minister's address would help the unions decide if they return to work on Monday or not.
