JAMES MAHLOKWANE Gauteng Premier David Makhura and MEC for Human Settlements Dikgang Moiloa visited Hammanskraal communities to discuss solutions to demands that caused protests in the area last week. Ward 74 councillor Brenda Siphuthuma worked with community leadership to invite Makhura and Moiloa to the angry community. The cadres were taken around to see some of the areas that needed urgent service delivery in ward 74. MEC Panyaza Lesufi also showed up to address the community and address matters that needed his office's intervention. Some of the problems raised included inadequate roads, RDP houses, utility infrustructure, sewerage safety. Over 500 community members travelled from across different communities to hear Makhura, Moiloa and Lesufi. The community had protested near the N1 highway a week ago. They burnt items on the the wall separating the communities from the highway in the process. Councillor Siphuthuma said she had to rally support from various community leaders to help her speak to angry community leaders last week Saturday. "I had to speak to the people who were angry and calm them down. Some of them were even threatening to come and burn my house when riots started last week. That is why I had to bring leaders from the highest office of government."
