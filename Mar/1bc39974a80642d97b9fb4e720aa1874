Yesterday, a senior manager stationed in Region 6 was accosted by criminals while on duty attending to a service delivery interruption in Nellmapius, next to Mamelodi. The manager was robbed of his vehicle, phones as well as other items. Also, at about 7pm last Tuesday, technicians had to respond to a power outage affecting Olievenhoutbosch. While at the substation, they were held hostage and prevented from restoring electricity supply to the community. The were only freed the next morning. “While this aggression is meted out to our personnel it translates into delays in carrying out our maintenance responsibilities. "I urge communities to shield our employees from such unwarranted violence,” said Mosola. He expressed his disgust at the deviant behaviour and vandalisation of the municipality’s infrastructure in the seven regions of the city. In Region 3 alone there had been four incidents of theft and damage to infrastructure in recent weeks, Mosola said. “I would like to thank all our consumers who were affected by the service disruptions for their patience and understanding following the recent downpours. “We have managed to restore fundamental services in the form of water and electricity to 90% of the affected areas, despite the difficult rainy conditions,” he said. “We are working hard to catch up with the outstanding and reported complaints, most of which are individual complaints, that have been logged with our customer service centres. “We apologise profusely for the inconvenience caused.”
