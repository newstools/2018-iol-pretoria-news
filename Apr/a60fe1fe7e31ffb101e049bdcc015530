Last month, Australian Minister of Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who also holds the ministerial post for immigration and border protection, claimed white South African farmers “deserve special attention” because of the “horrific circumstances” of land seizures and violence in the country. The comments drew criticism from SA’s Department of International Relations and Co-operation. However, on Monday, Dirco said in a terse statement that Sisulu welcomed the Australian leaders' retraction of the comments made by their home affairs minister. “The Minister of International Relations and Co-operation, Honourable Lindiwe Sisulu, has noted and welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop’s retraction of the comments made by their Home Affairs Minister, Mr Peter Dutton, on the South African land redistribution process,” said the statement. Sisulu said: “We welcome the assurance by the Australian government as reported in the media that the comments made by their home affairs minister are not in line with Australian immigration policy. We also welcome Australia's condemnation of the unfortunate comments by South African and other international organisations and leaders. We must emphasise, as we have stated before, that no one is being persecuted in South Africa, including white farmers. We call upon all non-governmental organisations to desist from spreading untruths and misleading information.” Sisulu said South Africa was a law-abiding country and, through a constitutional process, it would arrive at solutions on land redistribution that would take the country forward without violating anyone's rights. “South African diplomatic channels are always open to those who may wish to seek clarity on our country's policy positions,” the statement said. - African News Agency (ANA)
