JAMES MAHLOKWANE Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Services was still under heavy renovations to separate the gallows from the maximum security prison for safety and efficiency purposes, said spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. The maximum prison has two museums, the gallows museum and the Correctional Services Museum. The latter has its own building and has long been operational and open to the public. On the contrary, the much talked about gallows was attached to the prison’s notorious C-Max. Scores of prisoners and political prisoners were executed at the gallows. The gallows’ interior was designed in 2015 by numerous experts who also helped design the Nelson Mandela National Museum. Although the public and filmmakers were impatiently waiting for the museum to be opened to the public, it was not ideal. Correctional Services did not want tourists to go through the maximum prison just to arrive at the gallows. The department, subsequently, opted to first complete the second phase of the project. The second phase construction would separate the museum from C-Max and create a new entrance and parking for tourists. Nxumalo said: “At the moment we do not have a timeline of when the heavy construction will be completed and we therefore cannot say when the museum would be open to the public. Even filmmakers have been phoning asking to film at the gallows but unfortunately the construction is not completed.”
