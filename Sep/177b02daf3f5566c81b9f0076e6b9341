Global and local media turned cameras towards anti-apartheid activist Mathews Phosa who was announced as the BEE partner of an aerospace defence company, Paramount South Africa. Phosa will be the chairman of this exciting company set to design and supply defence equipment and technology that could be utilised by forces from the South African National Defence Force and other policing authorities. This is so far the biggest, if not one of the biggest, announcements made at the Africa Aerospace Defence exhibition (AAD2018) that was launched yesterday at Waterkloof Air Force Base. Phosa spoke fluently with pride and joy while the audience applauded the announcement this afternoon. He told the Pretoria News that this achievement was a demonstration that every black child could achieve anything they set their eyes on. He said the aerospace defence manufacturing industry was currently predominately white and it was about time black role players came in, not as disruptors, but contributors and owners.

The Paramount Group was founded in South Africa many years ago but it made a conscious decision not to do big business in South Africa. It manufactured products in the country and distributed them to the rest of the world. Phosa and his team have already started meeting clients and interacting with industry role players to grow the company. His team has its own offices of business. Phosa issued a warning to all the poachers killing rhinos and elephants for their horns, saying his company will manufacture technology that will make it difficult for them to hide or get away with the crime that targeted animals.
