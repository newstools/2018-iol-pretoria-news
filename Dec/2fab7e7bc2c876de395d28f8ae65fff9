Those who heed the call will be entertained by Cassper Nyovest, DJ Sumbody and Nasty C, among others stars. The get-together and music festival returns to Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on December 26. It celebrates a decade of existence this year, and will showcase more musicians, including Malome hitmaker Lamiez Holworthy from Live Amp, DJ Christos, Okmalumkoolkat and DJ PH. Cooler Boxing Day has become one of the most much anticipated events on the capital city’s entertainment calendar, drawing about 12000 people each year. What started off as a small gathering in 2009 has grown to be a massive event, said co-founder Tebatso Kiewet. The event wanted to promote Atteridgeville and the capital as the place to be in December. Kiewet said event goers can expect a must-attend musical festival. “But there is always a cherry on top; so people must expect to be wowed by the performances, from local to national artists. “Fireworks and a cake will be there as it is our birthday, as well as a variety of food stalls. “We are not blowing our own horn, but people in and around Atteridgeville have been anticipating this event to show that for the past 10 years we have been providing something they look forward to all year. “The ambience is going to be out of this world,” Kiewet said. He said the event would not just offer fun, but also involve empowering the youth by creating jobs. “The organisers will employ about 280 staff from the Atteridgeville community.” There will be tight security at the venue. The Metro Police, Tshwane Emergency Services and Disaster Management will also be on guard. Kiewet said: “Gates open at 12pm. The theme for this year is All White.”
