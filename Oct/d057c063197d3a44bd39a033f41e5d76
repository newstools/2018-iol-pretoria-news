The men and women known for their formal dress uniforms or fatigues proved that they were not just about parades and parachutes, but that they were also good all-round sportsmen and women. Even a parade held at the event was not performed in the perfectly pressed jackets and trousers, but in vests and shorts. The week-long activities will see members participate in various sporting codes, recreational and cultural activities which include soccer, netball, rugby, track and field events, swimming and various forms of target shooting. There will be a cycling challenge and even angling to bring together the men and women of the armed forces and encourage fitness and social cohesion among members through sports, as a fundamental of a combat-ready defence force. They will compete in different categories in order to secure honours for their represented service arms and divisions, aiming for the trophies up for grabs at an award ceremony on Friday. While some members participated in various activities, others cheered from the sidelines to help their team members do well. Physical Training Sports and Recreation senior staff officer Colonel William Bangiso said the week’s activities were dedicated to all sports codes within the SANDF. He said he was proud to witness the growth of the annual event. “The SANDF has a total of 36 sports codes.” He was pleased that all regions were represented as well as the four arms of service: Army, Air Force, Navy and Military Health. Winning teams will be categorised into three; best overall sporting code, best improved sporting code and the best administrator. Winners will be announced during a gala dinner at the South African Military Health Service Training Formation on Friday.
