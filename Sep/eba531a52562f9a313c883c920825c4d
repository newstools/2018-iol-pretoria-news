Pretoria - The Economic Freedom Fighters clad in their party regalia continue to picket outside the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. The court is currently hearing two separate full bench applications involving the party. The first application is a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Riotous Assembly Act of 1956 and the second one is an application for leave to appeal brought by Former President Jacob Zuma. The picket has affected traffic on the intersection of Bosman and Madiba Streets as cars are not allowed down Madiba Street. Picketers are in high spirits as they dance and chant revolutionary songs. South African Police Service members are closely monitoring the situation outside the court. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Malema, who arrived at court around 10 am, is being represented by Advocate Thembeka Ngcukaitobi on his application to challenge the constitutionality of the Riotous Assemblies Act. The party leader faces criminal charges of allegedly contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act after calling for land invasions. In 2014 during the partyâ€™s elective conference in Bloemfontein, Malema told his party members that they should occupy land. In June 2016, he told supporters in Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal to occupy land as it belonged to the black people. Pretoria News
