The food bank feeds 221 NPOs and 1666 individuals on a regular basis. In the first quarter of the 2018/19 financial year, it provided food parcels to 3810 needy and hunger-stricken beneficiaries as part of its efforts to fight hunger and poverty. One of the NPOs it feeds, Kopano Manyano God the Founder Centre for the Homeless, said the status of the food bank was at this stage of concern because it fed more than a 150 homeless people on the streets. Kopano Manyano leader Tebogo Mpufane said they were appreciative of how the message of the food bank's depletion was communicated. He said the turn of events meant they had to carefully watch how they used the remaining food. “We recently went through a verification process because some NPOs are operating as ghost organisations. We passed the verification and were surprised by the quantity of food in the batch; it was immensely small to what we usually receive, but we were reassured that by the end of November we might receive something. “We are happy because the City will facilitate linkages between donors and needy organisations or families; this link between donors and families is great news.” MMC for Health Sakkie du Plooy said it was important to inform regular beneficiaries of the food bank timeously of a possible reduction in the size of parcels while waiting for the finalisation of the procurement process to fully restock the facility. He said the stock was depleted after the recent aid to victims of blazes in Mooiplaas, Laezonia, Plastic View 1 and Plastic View 2 informal settlements, which were destroyed by fire. “Owing to the latest predicament, the City urges all other stakeholders in the community to assist our regular beneficiaries that may not get adequate supplies from the food bank with humanitarian assistance aimed at reducing suffering,” Du Plooy said.
