The workers affiliated to National Education Health & Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) went on an indefinite strike yesterday, chanting Struggle songs and emptying dustbins in front of  their department building in the Pretoria city centre. They threatened to withdraw other workers responsible for drawing water from the dams to municipalities if the department did not attend to their grievances. Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba said: “Today (yesterday) was the first day of the strike and we will assess the impact of the strike as it goes on. As and when we realise it is not yielding the desired results, we will have to recall those comrades who are working in the dams to make sure there will be disruption of water supply.” Workers went on strike over unpaid bonuses, the lack of protective clothing, poor working environments and rampant corruption in the department. “The biggest demand of the union is (about) outsourcing. The department is outsourcing most of its work to outside contractors while it has a capable in-house team that build dams. The work to build dams is given to outside companies and that's how the department loses money. That's why it can't buy protective clothing for workers at the dams,” Xaba said. However, he said the union remained hopeful that the department would soon restart the negotiations and resolve the impasse. “(In the meantime) the consumers must brace themselves for water disruptions,” he said. He explained that while the municipalities carried the responsibility to supply water to communities, it was the department that drew it from the dams to supply municipalities. “If our members at the dams don't go to work, there'll be no one to open the switches. That means the municipalities won’t get water. Municipalities don’t have access to the dams. If we cut the water, communities won’t get water,” he said.
