The show is on at the State Theatre every Friday and Saturday night as part of the Youth Month commemoration. The dance production looks at the life of a 15-year-old village girl who misses school because of a lack of sanitary towels. “Masechaba represents every girl, especially girls from the villages, who miss school for up to 10 days whenever they are on their periods,” she said. Lebeloane said she spoke on behalf of village girls as she was a village girl herself. Therefore, she  knew of the hardships faced by many young girls each month. The 26-year-old, originally from Shakung village in the North West and now residing in Ga-Rankuwa, said she knew of stories where young girls used newspapers, tissues and socks among other things due to lack of sanitary products. “All these things that these girls use are not good for their health. So the motivation behind the play was to question whether or not the country is equal. “Today, 24 years into democracy, we say we are a democratic country, yet a girl child still skips school for close to 10 days due to lack of sanitary towels. “We call for a female president, but probably our future female presidents are stuck at home because they don’t have sanitary towels,” Lebeloane said. Her play offered a solution to the problem. “The first step to finding a solution is through introspection; to ask how you as a citizen can be a solution to the problem. “The play is about that, awareness and introspection, where as much as we expect someone else to bring solutions, what are you as the audience watching the show doing about this crisis we are facing. “Why are you on the sidelines asking what the government is doing about the problem?”
