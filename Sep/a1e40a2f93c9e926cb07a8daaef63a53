The Midland team competed against seven other schools from four regions to take the title during the final quiz, held at IIE Varsity College Sandton yesterday. Coming a close second was Eden College from Durban. The eight finalists were selected on their scores during the regional finals that were hosted by four titles within Independent Media - The Star, Daily News (Durban), Cape Argus and Pretoria News. Pretoria Boys High and Pretoria Chinese School represented the capital. Quiz questions were drawn from articles in the regionâ€™s newspapers, with questions for the final based on selected articles on the IOL website. There were five categories with 10 questions per round for the final. These ranged from relatively simple news questions to those requiring more specialised knowledge. The quiz has the support of the Gauteng Department of Education, which is considering introducing it to more schools. - Staff Reporter
