The 20-year-old first-year sports science student scored his first Varsity goal against the University of the Western Cape (UWC) last week. Tlisane Motaung, the UP-Tuks head coach, describes Murchie as a natural finisher. “He has pace, he has strength and he has an aerial presence,” said Motaung. “To top it all, he is a good goal-poacher. It is guaranteed that if you create enough chances, he will find the back of the net. It is in his genes.” In the Castle League, Murchie scored 15 goals. “Usually after being about 20 minutes on the field I start to get a feel for the game, knowing when to be where,” said Murchie, who is 1.65m tall and weighs 65kg. “Most teams want big, strong strikers who can hold the ball for them. That I can do, but I am also able to cause fouls at the edge of the box because of my size. When the bigger defenders try and take advantage of my small stature, I am able to turn the tables on them. “Scoring my first Varsity goal against UWC was special. At first, I could not believe that I had scored. However, the moment I realised it was a goal I was happy and emotional at the same time.” Tuks play Tshwane University of Technology today in a home semifinal of the Varsity Football Tournament.
