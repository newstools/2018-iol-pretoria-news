General Khehla Sitole and Minister Bheki Cele have been requested to classify child abuse as a priority crime, in order to ensure that sexual offenders are more heavily sentenced, and to make the sexual offences register publicly available. This comes after the horrific events at Dros, Silverton where a 7-year-old girl was raped. Tutela, a non-profit child protection organisation, launched the "SaveOurChildren" campaign to request the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele and the National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John Sitole to intervene. A landing webpage was created to enable the public to send an automated email requesting the following: * Classify child abuse as a priority crime * Make the sexual offences registry publicly available * Give stricter sentencing for sexual offenders The recent release of the 2017/2018 national crime statistics, by the South African Police Services shows that an increasing number of children are being murdered. According to Botha Van Aarde, CEO of Tutela, hundreds of people have already submitted their votes. "South Africans are shocked at the events that occurred at the Dros in Silverton. "But the reality is that child abuse is not only a few isolated cases. "In the East Rand alone, Tutela protects and relocates at least two children per day. "The children we save have been abused constantly." "Child abuse statistics, and more specifically, the amount of murders and sexual offences against children, are just unacceptable. #We cannot sit by and watch vulnerable children being subjected to some of the most horrific crimes you can think of. "We have to mobilise and take action, so that we can save and protect more children".
