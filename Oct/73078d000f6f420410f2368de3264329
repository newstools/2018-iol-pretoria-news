The music streaming company's vision is for Global Cultures is to connect audiences, to bring cultures from all over the world together and open a lens into fresh parts of this small world. The Global Cultures editorial team initiated this global plan with the Latin and Desi hubs followed by today’s launch of the Afro Hub. This Afro Hub from Spotify celebrates and honours the African culture as well as it’s widely known and loved music. According to Spotify, it is their mission to bring to light every layer of this ancient, expressive and rhythmic musical culture which is an important element of today’s mainstream, modern music. Made up of a range of different styles, African music has influenced genres in the United States and abroad for centuries. Afro Hub will feature multiple tiers of content including news, podcasts and playlists. A few examples of the hub’s playlists include: African Heat (Top Hits); Peppeh (Early Bets) and Gold Mine (Classics). There will also be playlists that highlight the continent’s best tracks within continental shelves (ex. West Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa). The hub will also offer unique content including playlist takeovers from artists like Major Lazer, Wizkid, Jacob Banks, Burna Boy and Bas & Mereba, and podcasts by Jesus & Jollof feat. Yvonne Orji and Luvvie Ajayi. Afro Hub is available to both free and premium Spotify users. Follow the Business Report on Instagram here BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
