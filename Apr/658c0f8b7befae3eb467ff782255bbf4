Baloyi who was eight-years-old had been missing for three days before he was found dead in a nearby area. Community members say the suspect was on parole when he committed the crime, adding that Baloyi’s passing came as a shock as the suspect seemed like a "changed man".

During the memorial service teachers described Baloyi as a child full of life who would always greet and loved people. “When he first came here last year I saw a loving and bright child. "If other children did not have stationary he would share with them, it is a great loss,” one of the teachers said. “I really don't know how to feel about this because we were with him on Friday and on Monday we received the news of his tragic passing,” the teacher added.
