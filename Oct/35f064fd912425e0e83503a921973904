The organisation represents municipalities in the electricity sector, including entities such as electricity distributors, parastatals, academics and other stakeholders with interests in the energy sector in Southern Africa. A senior manager at the City of Tshwane’s electricity department, Mokgosi was announced as the new president during the 26th electricity conference hosted by her organisation at the CSIR last week. She saays that the association was for donkey’s years run by “a boys’ choir”, with the exclusion of their female counterparts. While many in the fraternity of energy industry celebrate her presidency as the first black female leader of the association, Mokgosi prefers to be modest about it. “I understand what people are saying, but there was a female president before who was an Indian. Yes, they are right, I am the first black president. When it started it was male-dominated and a boys' choir of some sort.” Despite that there had been strides made in terms of challenging deeply-rooted patriarchy in the organisation, Mokgosi says: “This sector is still a male-dominated sector. I remember that when I started I was faced with challenges emanating from my male colleagues. I had to fight for myself as a woman to be noticed as a capable electrician.” She bitterly complained about the unfair treatment to the point where she raised the matter with her superiors. She says she would like to continue furthering legacies of her other predecessors by empowering women through a programme called Women in Electricity, which was started in 2016. The programme focuses on various aspects of development. “It is crucial for the sector to accommodate females within the industry. I will therefore remain interested in the subject of women empowerment as the new president,” she added.
