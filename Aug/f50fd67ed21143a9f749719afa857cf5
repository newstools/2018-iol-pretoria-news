Students at Tshwane University of Technology in Soshanguve will shut down the university and protest until management answer their calls, following the fatal shooting of a student during council elections. Violence broke out among students who attended the election of a new student representative council on Thursday night. It is believed that shots were fired after claims of vote rigging. Various student organisations say there won’t be any classes at all TUT campuses in Pretoria today. University spokesperson Willa de Ruyter begs to differ saying  that the campus is open but that extra security has been deployed. In a video posted on social media, some students can be heard shouting while others throw chairs and assault one another. Some videos showed that several fires had been started on the campus‚ with disgruntled students setting alight ballot papers. "So far, we are going to investigate the circumstances of the incident as we are not clear what actually transpired," says police spokesperson, Kay Makhubele.
