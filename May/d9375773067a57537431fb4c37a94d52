Rapula Moatshe THE DA-led administration in Tshwane will continue to lessen financial burdens faced by poor households by exempting them from paying for municipal services. This was according to mayor Solly Msimanga during his delivery of what he termed a "balanced budget" for 2018/2019 at Sammy Marks Council Chamber on Thursday. "The City in its tariff determination has taken into account the affordability of services to its residents. We made every effort to contain the tariffs that are within our control such as the charges relating to property rates and refuse removal and ensure they are in line with inflation," he said. Msimanga said the City was fully committed towards ensuring that the poorest residents were either exempt or paying significantly reduced tariffs. "Residents who are registered as indigents are granted 12kℓ of water free of charge, along with 100 kWh of electricity free of charge. Indigents also pay no property rates to the City. In terms of property rates, there is no charge on any properties that are valued at R130 000 or less," he said. He said the City has a rebate scheme for pensioners and the disabled as anyone in this category earning, for example, R8 000 or less is entitled to a 50% rebate on their property rates. The exemption for the poor from paying for services was made despite that the City experienced increases in its bulk purchases of electricty and water from Rand Water and Eskom, respectively. Msimanga said the tariff increases for electricity and water are informed by what is determined by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa and Rand Water. He said Eskom's bulk purchase tariff increase is 7.32%, but the City is internalising some of the costs so that the full amount is not passed on to our residents and business owners. He said the City has applied for an electricity tariff increase of 6,84% as per Nersa guideline. Rand Water, on the other hand, has increased their bulk water sales to the city by 12.2%. But, Msimanga said the residents will be made to pay 10,5% of the amount while the city will absorb 2,2% the remaining cost. "This demonstrates our commitment towards ensuring that the City of Tshwane is an affordable place in which to live," he said. The total capital budget of the city amounted to R4 billion for the 2018/19 period  with a projected 3,9 billion and R4,1 billion for 2019/20 and for 2020/21 respectively. The budget for the 2017/18 had an operating budget of approximately R30 billion, and a capital budget of R3.9bn. Msimanga said the capital budget for 2018/19 is funded from internally generated revenue, which included public contributions and donations and capital replacement reserve. "The City is tabling an operating revenue (excluding capital grants and contributions) of R32,5 billion for the period 2018/19 which escalates to R36,5 billion in 2020/21," he said. Msimanga said the revenue represents an increase of 6% against the 2017/18 adjustment budget. The operating expenditure of the city amounts to R32,4 billion - an increase of 5,7% against the 2017/18 adjustment budget. Msimanga said an increase in operating expenditure meant the city has a surplus of R113,5 million for this current financial year. He said property rates tariffs will increase with 6% from 1 July 2018 for all categories of properties except the business, commercial category and industrial properties, which will have an increase of 4%. "The tariff structure for refuse removal comprises of two components, which is for refuse removal and city cleaning.  The tariff for refuse removal is based on the cost per m³ (container capacity) of refuse removed per month and on the service provided in a specific area," he said.
