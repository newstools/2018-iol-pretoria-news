Pretoria - There’s a standoff between angry Tshwane University of Technology students and police at the Soshanguve Magistrate's Court, following the appearance of two police officers for the death of a TUT student. There was minimal activity in the early morning with no hype until after 9am. Students came marching down from the TUT Soshanguve campus chanting and holding up placards. They were denied access into the court premises when they arrived. Numerous policemen manned the gate while students pushed and shoved their way through. Eventually students pushed in and occupied part of the court outside. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
