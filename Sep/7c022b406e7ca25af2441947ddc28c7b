The official opposition in the metro garnered 62% during the by-election on Wednesday. Maepa took to social media to celebrate the win, saying it demonstrated the people were “tired of the DA”, which bagged 11% of the votes. “The DA brought with it blue lights, food parcels, blankets, election experts from Cape Town and 5000 plus T-shirts they were flatly rejected by Soshanguve residents,” Maepa said. DA regional leader Abel Tau denied the allegations, saying it was the ANC that brought its political bigwigs, who were driven in blue-light vehicles. “The allegations against the DA are false. Maepa brought in Premier David Makhura and Transport MEC Dr Ismail Vadi and the blue-light vehicles.” Tau claimed a businessperson was spotted distributing 1200 ANC T-shirts outside one of the polling stations. “The election process was free and fair, but the environment intimidated people to come out and cast their votes freely,” Tau said. The ANC won with the majority of votes, but its margin slightly dropped from the 66.73% it registered in 2016. The EFF, on the other hand, increased its margin from 22% two years ago to 26% and the DA grew its support from 8.6% to 11%. The ANC victory meant it would retain its council seat, left vacant after the death of councillor Siphiwe Montlha, who was gunned down in May outside his house. The new councillor is Saki Ntohla.
