Last month in Pretoria, armed robbers managed to flee with an undisclosed amount of money on the N4 west, between the R80 and Ga-Rankuwa. In January, a cash-in-transit van was blown up on the N14, before Eeufees Road, where robbers also fled with an undisclosed amount of money. More recently, robbers struck near MultiChoice in Randburg, Joburg north. “Cash-in-transit crime is rapidly becoming one of the biggest dangers to the South African public,” said Mark Barrett, group chief executive of SBV Services. “Videos of the incidents show  a complete disregard for lives, not only for our industry personnel who are trained to face this type of combat, but more importantly for innocent bystanders. Everyone in the vicinity of that attack was at risk,” he said. Although the videos were terrifying to watch, they were a good example of how citizen journalism and eye-witness accounts could assist in exposing the extent of cash-in-transit violence, and assist law enforcement in identifying perpetrators. Barrett warned that it was important for citizens to never put themselves at risk. “Cash-in-transit thugs are a danger to South Africa. We appeal to the public to assist us and the authorities with any information related to these crimes. These criminals are surrounded by family and friends who know what they're doing - by speaking up you could help save a life. Whether it's an early warning or information about a past cash-in-transit, it's time to blow the whistle,” said Barrett.
