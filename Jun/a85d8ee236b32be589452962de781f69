Ndlovu was last seen on Benson’s family’s farm in Mooinooi near Brits on August2, 2016. The State claimed that 24-year-old Benson shot and killed Ndlovu that day, while he and two friends were on the farm stealing oranges and scrap metal. According to Ndlovu’s friends, Benny Lerumo and Thabiso Shole, he was shot in the leg. They could not identify who shot him, but said they saw Benson in the vicinity. The two tried to carry and drag their injured friend to safety, but left him on the farm and ran for safety up a mountain after he had fainted. Both testified that while they were on the mountain, they saw several people in the spot where they had left Ndlovu. However, they said it was too far for them to see who the people were. Ndlovu was not seen again, and even a police search with dogs failed to locate him. Benson, meanwhile, pleaded not guilty to an array of charges in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, including murder, the attempted murder of Lerumo and Shole as well as defeating the ends of justice. The State claims that he disposed of the body under circumstances not known to it. The incident sparked a lot of racial tension between communities in the area. Benson denied firing any shot, or that he knew anything about ­Ndlovu’s injuries. His advocate, Jaap Cilliers, said it was impossible that he could have fired the shots as he was on a motorcycle on his way to the main farm house at the time. The surviving friends this week testified how they hid under some bushes while shots were fired at them. They later ran towards the mountain while helping their wounded friend. But Cilliers, during cross-examination, said that Lerumo later went back to the farm with the police and a sniffer dog to point out the route that they took to try to escape with the bleeding Ndlovu. Cilliers said one would expect a blood trail, but not even the sniffer dog could pick up any blood.
