They expressed heartfelt gratitude to a soup kitchen organised by a group of young people under the banner 100+Movement. Its spokesperson Tebatso Griffiths said the good work to feed the hungry was in its fourth year and continued to grow every year. He said the idea to help out was motivated by the desire from young people to alleviate social ills such as poverty, which was prevalent in many communities. Many of the recipients were living in shacks at the nearby informal settlement. “It helps a lot. It might just be one day but we do it out of our own pocket. It would be very hard to sustain on a more regular basis. The people are receiving it with warm hearts. South Africa still has more unequal communities. This area is generally a poor place in the west of Pretoria,” he said. The people were also elated to be  handed second-hand clothes donated by good Samaritans. “They are definitely happy with what we are doing. We do this once a year and every day you walk down the streets people will come up to you to ask ‘when are you doing the soup kitchen again?’” Griffiths said. Different kinds of donations such as second-hand clothing, blankets, soup and beans came from ordinary people and local businesspeople, he said. “It has been very successful over the years and we have served more than 2000 people annually. It started off a bit small with about 300 people coming and people donating pots and clothes and now it is growing more and more,” he said. The event was hosted towards winter season every year to keep people warm, Griffiths said. “We find that people don’t have blankets and warm clothes during this season. This is a challenging season and there is not much that people can do to get warm clothes. We want to show them that we are here and we will warm up each other,” he said.
