Pretoria - It’s been chock-a-block since the wee hours of the morning at malls in the city, as people scramble for their favourite items. Shoppers all around the city began their Black Friday last night, waiting outside some of the stores, that opened at midnight, to get the best deals. At Menlyn Park Shopping Centre, some shops were open from midnight. Shops like Zara, Timberland and Game have snaking queues as people waited for their chance through the doors. Customers were let in one by one. Brain Sanders, a father of two, said despite hating malls and Black Friday, he could not pass up the opportunity to find a bargain.

Sbusiso Ngidi said he had never shopped at the mall before. "I don't like coming and shopping. What can we do? We want to help the family. I need to save." Another shopper Kgomotso Modibe , said she loved the hype around Black Friday. "For me, it is fun. I love getting bargains and I enjoy the mall atmosphere." In Soshanguve, shoppers scrambled in at Shoprite from about 7am. Eggs, coffee, bread and juice were a high commodity.  In Wonderboom, people patiently lined up outside Makro for the gadgets. Top of the list were plasma TVs and cellphones. At Forest Hill Mall in Centurion the fever hadn’t really caught on. The mall is just normal with no queues. But there is a heavy police visibility.
