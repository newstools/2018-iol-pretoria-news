The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that for millions of people worldwide, poverty prevents them from buying a toothbrush, making it difficult to maintain healthy teeth and gums. Due to that, “Buy A Brush, Help A Child” initiative by Colgate-Palmolive South Africa in partnership with the Dis-Chem Foundation seeks to lend  a helping hand to children in need. Today the Colgate team took to the City to educate pupils at Arcadia Primary School on oral care. The day kicked off with some basics steps of brushing teeth, singing and a movie on oral hygiene. Giggles and sounds of disgust were heard in between the movie scenes. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The participation from pupils was vibrant as they proved to have paid attention throughout the movie. They (pupils) told the Colgate team that they brushed their teeth twice a day and vowed to keep doing so. “Dental cavities are the most prevalent childhood condition in our country. "We are faced with an overwhelming burden of treatment that is needed for oral care conditions,” said Dr Stephanus Crous of Colgate Oral Care. She said Colgate assists the country’s healthcare system to promote good oral hygiene through programmes like the Bright Smiles, Bright Future and the Buy a Brush, Help a Child CSI initiative, by providing oral health education, free toothbrushes and toothpaste to children in grades R-3,” Colgate has called on citizens to purchase toothbrushes at any participating Dis-Chem pharmacy in order for a toothbrush, toothpaste and access to oral care education to be given to a child in need.
