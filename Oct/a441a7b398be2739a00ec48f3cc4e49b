The motion was brought about by the DA, which governs Tshwane, described by Makhura as the worst performing metro in the province. Could it be that the drama at Tshwane House has negatively affected service delivery, or was Makhura playing to the gallery? After all, he will be the ANCâ€™s candidate for premier, while Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga leads the DA in Gauteng into the general election next year. Be that as it may, what transpired yesterday in the fallout between Msimanga and city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola is shocking to say the least. Mosola, who successfully interdicted the tabling of the report of the GladAfrica tender irregularity probe to council, went short of calling Msimanga a liar when he addressed the media yesterday. Msimanga, in a statement of his own, adopted a diplomatic tone and chose to clarify his position, while having a go at the ANC, for seemingly not deciding whether or not it supported the city manager. One can only hope that while Mosola and his political masters slug it out, service delivery is not compromised, after all, local government is all about service delivery. It is a pity that this vital function has been overtaken by political shenanigans.
