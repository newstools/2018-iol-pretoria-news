Yesterday the DA in Gauteng North announced Daryl Johnston as its candidate for the by-election at the Sunrise View Old-Age Home in Rietvalleirand. The by-election follows the resignation of DA veteran ward councillor Rita Aucamp due to health reasons. DA spokesperson for public enterprises, MP Natasha Mazzone, said Aucamp remained an active member of the party, but was unable to execute her duties to what she felt was her full potential. “Her health is certainly problematic but it’s not dire, and so she decided to step back.” The ward includes Elardus Park, Wingate Park, Moreleta Park and Rietvalleirand - a stronghold of the DA for the past decade. “It falls within a DA constituency predominantly surrounded by DA wards. It’s been DA led and I’m pretty sure after the elections it will continue to be led by the DA,” she said. Although the voters roll has closed, voters had until yesterday to apply for a special vote ahead of the election expected to take place on April 25. Johnston told the hall packed with elderly people at the retirement village that he was honoured to be chosen and would carry the baton from Aucamp. “I know the ward faces its own challenges, like abandoned roads, crime and old substations. My role and duty is to better those challenges,” he said. ANC Tshwane regional secretary Paul Mojapelo acknowledged that the ward had over the years been DA led, but said anything was possible in politics. “We have faith in our candidate Beverly Brown and believe the ANC can offer better services,” he said. Mojapelo said even if they didn’t win that particular ward, the ANC remained the leader in society. Brown also acknowledged the chances of winning were slim, but said it was worth a good fight. “In the last elections the DA got 85% and the ANC 5.7%. Be that as it may, we will continue to fight and make our communities better,” she said. Brown said she would improve the ward infrastructure.
