This comes after Parliament’s legal adviser told the committee on mineral resources they could not meet potential witnesses in the inquiry due to budgetary constraints. DA MP James Lorimer said: “I'll be blunt. Either a budget has not been provided or a political decision has been made behind closed doors to close down this inquiry. “In the hope that it is the first, I suggest we request Parliament for a budget. I don’t believe it is an oversight but an attempt to use procedure to shut down this inquiry which I find unacceptable,” said Lorimer. The committee decided to set up a full blown inquiry after Zwane failed more than three times to appear before the committee to answer questions on state capture allegations. Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Zwane, the province’s former agriculture MEC, have both been linked to a scheme to unlawfully enrich the Guptas through the Vrede dairy farm. Lorimer said the ANC under President Cyril Ramaphosa was prepared to do no more than sweep corruption under the carpet. “The Ramaphosa administration has sought to portray itself as a new broom that will sweep away the abuses of the Zuma years. But by trying to sweep abuses under the carpet, it is clear that the reputation of the ANC is being put above the need to hold people accountable for criminal and ethically unacceptable acts that have ruined the reputation of our mining industry and rendered it all but uninvestable,” said Lorimer. The ANC rejected the DA claims, and insisted that the only reason it is against the inquiry is because Parliament did not have money for it. ANC MP Motsoaledi Matlala said: “We are not hiding from this inquiry, we don’t have the money. Parliament does not have this money. The other issue is calling someone who is no longer an executive member before such an inquiry. It is not allowed by the law. Let’s close this matter.”
