Organisers of the African Aerospace Defence exhibition (AAD2018) are ready to host tens of thousands of people when the show opens for the public tomorrow morning. Friends and families will descend on the Waterkloof Air Force Base to watch air shows they’ve been waiting to enjoy since preparations started early this year. Pilots are brushing up their rehearsals to impress the people who’ve purchased tickets to enjoy this internationally anticipated bi-annual show. Organisers promised plenty of entertainment and information and have ensured there is enough space for visitors to move around in, restaurants, mobile toilets, security and standby emergency services personnel. Parents bringing their children to the show will be delighted to hear that there is a youth development programme stall near Hangar One. Ordinary people will have opportunities to take a closer look at luxurious private jets that that have been put up for sale at the outside exhibition space. At the moment, national and international delegates representing various governments and defence forces are wrapping up their tours to the exhibitors’ stalls and hangars. Traffic will be affected on Solomon Mahlangu, the off-ramp on the R21 highway, and Trichardt Road, leading to the main entrance on Veldpou Street. There will be road closures on Dastek and Van Ryneveld avenues and motorists are advised to use Botha and Rigel avenues to access waterkloof Air Force Base. Only park-and-ride buses will be allowed to use Trichardt and Veldpou Streets.
