Speaking outside the Western Cape High Court yesterday, De Lille said the matter was postponed inside the judge’s chambers. “The reason for the postponement is that the court date was set for today, the 28th (yesterday). The DA was given time until June 18 to make their replying affidavit and they failed to do so," she said. "They only submitted their replying affidavit yesterday afternoon (Wednesday) on the 27th, 24 hours before the court had to meet this morning. “Obviously my lawyers still had to respond to it and we had to bring it to the judge so the judge could read it before the court this morning so the judge also did not take very kindly to it; the matter has now been postponed to November 1.” De Lille approached the court in February to set aside the Steenhuisen report, named after DA chief whip John Steenhuisen who led the probe into her. In order for her to challenge the report, she wants the evidence used in the Steenhuisen report, which influenced the DA’s decision to sanction De Lille for misconduct. The documents De Lille is demanding are a letter from JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety and security of the Cape Town city council, and an SMS she allegedly sent relating to the performance scoring of former city manager Achmat Ebrahim, at the time he applied for the position. It is alleged that De Lille demanded a good scoring for Ebrahim as she wanted him to secure the job, a charge she denies. Ebrahim resigned after the allegation was made and found himself facing suspension. On Wednesday, De Lille won her court battle against the DA. The court found the party had violated its own constitution and rules when it terminated her membership. - African News Agency (ANA)
