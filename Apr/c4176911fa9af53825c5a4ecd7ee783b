Among the pupils was 16-year-old Ntando Makwela who has written his first book and looked to inspire his peers and encourage them to continue reading. He said, seeing that his generation now had freedom, they could achieve anything they put their mind to, just as he had written his first book and was involved in many other initiatives. Entertaining their peers, educators and those gathered in the sanctuary room at the Pretoria heritage site Freedom Park is the Chief Albert Luthuli Primary School. The group told the story of Nelson Mandela through a play. The dialogue is hosted by Freedom Park, the Department of Education and Brand SA and among other things focuses around the Freedom Charter, The Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
