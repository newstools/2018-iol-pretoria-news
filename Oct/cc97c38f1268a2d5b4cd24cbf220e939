Severe weather conditions lashed parts of Gauteng at the weekend, with cars being caught up in flash floods and roads blocked by hail. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) had issued a notice for severe thunderstorms across Gauteng. It warned of possible hail, heavy downpours and strong winds. In addition to hail and damaging winds, the SAWS also indicated the likelihood for localised heavy and/or incidents of flash flooding for Gauteng as well as over the eastern parts of the North West, northern and eastern parts of the Free State and western Mpumalanga.
