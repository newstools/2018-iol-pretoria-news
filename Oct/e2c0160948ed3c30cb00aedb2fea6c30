But there was one very special guest at the event, Veronica Phillips - one of the last surviving victims of the Holocaust. Phillips - who was born in Budapest - has in the past shared her painful experiences of being in the World War II Nazi concentration camps as a young girl, losing her family, and the long-term effect of the Holocaust. The Day of German Unity is celebrated on October 3 in Germany, and commemorates the anniversary of German reunification which started with the falling of the Berlin Wall on November 9 in 1989, a wonderful moment in history when everything seemed possible, Schäfer said. He celebrated Germany’s place in Europe and its special relationship with South Africa, in particular historic, political and economic ties over the last 25 years. Staff Reporter
