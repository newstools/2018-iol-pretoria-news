Her contemporary painting style has been featured by various local and international brands, such as BMW, Honda, British Airways, Albany and Tastic rice. We visited her home near Mthambothini in Mpumalanga to speak to her about the importance of embracing one’s heritage and culture. “My heritage is part of who I am. It is important for everyone to love who they are and respect their culture. It can take you places and also put food on your table.” Mahlangu said young people should take it from her that sticking to their roots and embracing their traditions and culture could be their ticket to the world. She has proudly embraced her Ndebele culture throughout her life, in how she dresses, her hairstyle, and how she has decorated the interior and exterior of her home with iconic Ndebele shapes and colours. “All my life I have maintained the same hairstyle and worn my traditional regalia. This is who I am, and I am proud of it. I wish young people would go back to their roots and embrace who they are so that the world could recognise them for that."
