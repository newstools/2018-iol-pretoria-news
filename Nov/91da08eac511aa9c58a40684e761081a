The Gauteng Weather Service has warned that most parts of Gauteng will experience very high temperatures over the next four days. It has predicted temperatures up to and over 36°C until Friday. Jan Vermeulen from the Weather Service advised people to stay indoors, avoid direct sunlight, hydrate with liquids, not alcohol, avoid participating in strenuous activities and make sure pets and livestock have access to water. They were also advised to dress in light clothing. However, Vermeulen said, the heatwave to be experienced in Gauteng would be nothing compared to what other provinces such as the North West, eastern parts of the Western Cape and Free State could experience. “In places such as Upington, the temperature will sky-rocket to at least 40°C.” With the heat comes a call for residents to use water sparingly. The Department of Water and Sanitation’s Hosia Sithole said that although dam levels were stable, excessive evaporation would happen when a heatwave was experienced. He said that in no time dam levels could drop. “When the heatwave hits us people tend to cool themselves in every way possible; so our dam levels drop. “We are urging residents to use water efficiently and to recycle it where possible. We request residents to use the bare minimum of water.” The City of Tshwane also asked residents to continue using water sparingly to avoid water wastage and unnecessary interruptions. The appeal came after Rand Water issued a formal notification to restrict all the City's meters and for consumers to use water sparingly. Areas that face severe restrictions include Ga-Rankuwa Industrial sites, Mabopane, Ga-Rankuwa, Akasia Park, Kruisfontein, Brakfontein, Thaba Tshwane, Blair Athol, Pretoria West, Sunnyside, Arcadia, Meintjieskop, the City centre, Wonderboom, Saulsville and Erasmia. After all has been said and done, this is probably the perfect time to invest in a good quality fashionable straw hat or for families to invade the swimming pools.
