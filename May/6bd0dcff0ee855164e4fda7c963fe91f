The Hey That’s Us! Team will do that during the annual First Lego League competition in Debrecen, Hungary, from May16 to 19. Team member Lara Gouws said each year a challenge was set based on a real-world scientific topic. The theme for 2017/18 is Hydro Dynamics. Gouws said that in line with the theme, they were expected to learn all about water; how to find, transport, use or dispose of it. They also had to build, test, and programme an autonomous robot using Lego mindstorms technology to solve a set of missions in the robot game. The team members said they were looking forward to the competition and hoped to win. “There are a lot of bonding sessions for teams during these competitions, and connections are made there. Just three years ago we went on another international competition, and we made friends with whom we are still in touch. We are looking forward to building more friendships and having fun,” Gouws said. The Grade 12 pupil said they hoped to win as the team had put a lot of work into their robot. She said, however, that being a team of pupils from different schools was not easy. “Because we are from three different schools, time management is sometimes a bit of a challenge as it takes a lot to organise extramural activities. But even with the challenge, through dedication and hard work we will make it work,” she said. Team manager Lynelle van Heerden said she was very proud of the girls and the entire team as they had put in so much effort since the beginning of the competition last year. “I am very proud of the team, they have worked very hard. “We started last year and worked throughout the December exams, as the national competition was in the first week of December last year. “Every day after writing their exams they worked on the robots, and their hard work paid off. Seeing the team go to the international level makes me so proud of them,” she said.
