EVEN though the National Lottery Commission (NLC) prides itself on changing the lives of people their employees are left out in the cold. “Whose lives are you changing,” and “I’m upset 7% is disrespectful,” were some of the placards held by NLC employees affiliated to the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) who demonstrated outside the organisations offices in Hatfield this afternoon.
