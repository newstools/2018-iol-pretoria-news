The K9 member, named Olive, went missing on Sunday at about 7pm after rescuing the man who got lost on Friday. According to the police, Olive was allegedly chased by other dogs while members of the community and his handler Constable Songezile Katikati were about to reach their vehicle. Katikati said: “Olive is my best friend. He is humble and he cannot harm anyone as he is trained in rescuing people, seeking missing people and seeking evidence in crime scenes. “I plead with anyone who sees him to keep him and report to the police.” Katikati and Olive have been working together since 2012. Olive was awarded the “Best Rescuing Dog” in the Eastern Cape in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Olive is a German Shepherd dog, tan in colour with a black back and face. He also has a black leather belt with a clock around his neck. Acting Cluster Commander Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza said: “Olive is our member that never has disappointed us. When we send Constable Katikati and Olive to rescue someone we relax and remain assured that they’ll bring that missing person back to his/her family. It is therefore disturbing news to our cluster and other clusters to hear that he is missing. “Our members have been out there searching for him.” Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Olive is asked to contact Constable Songezile Katikati on 0727310155 or 0835303295. Information can also be shared on the SAPS Crime Stop 0860010111 or Crime Line 32211. - ANA
