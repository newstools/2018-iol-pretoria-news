In the video that has since gone viral, the pupils wait for the teacher to sit down before “fainting” to the hit song by Limpopo musician King Monada. The furious female teacher is heard challenging the pupils to take her to court. She also tells them she does want to see them in her class for the rest of the term. “You can go to wherever. I’ve had it up to here; you can go to court with me; I am so willing,” she said. Some found the video funny; others slammed the pupils, saying they should rather focus on their school work. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said they were aware of the video and pupils had to be reprimanded for ill-discipline. “We are aware of this unfortunate challenge in the said school. Pupils must be reminded that schools are for education. As such they must always focus on being enriched with knowledge for successful future endeavours. Ill-discipline will not assist them to achieve any objectives in schools.” The department strongly condemned any acts of misconduct, he said. “MEC Panyaza Lesufi has identified discipline as a priority. Any transgression of the school code of conduct dictates that necessary steps be taken against pupils." This was a critical time where schools were administering exams and such bad behaviour must be discouraged and will not be tolerated, he said. King Monada’s latest hit Malwedhe, released a few days ago, has been trending, largely because of the #IdibalaChallenge. The song talks about a person who gets a disease when his or her partner cheats - and then faints. As part of the #IdibalaChallenge, people take videos of themselves simulating a fainting spell. Participants have even simulated fainting while driving. The Road Traffic Management Corporation has warned of the dangers of taking part in the challenge while behind the wheel.
