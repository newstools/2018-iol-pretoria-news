MEMBERS of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development were this morning barred from conducting an oversight visit of the Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa Centre. Angel Khanyile, Member of Parliament, alongside DA spokesperson for social development, Justus de Goede and regional chairperson Abel Tau were to inspect the centre following allegations of financial mismanagement. After it was reported that R7 million in funding to the centre had disappeared. The funds from social development were meant to provide clothing, food and other necessities to orphaned, abandoned, abused and neglected children. However upon arrival at the centre to begin the oversight members were informed by centre management that they could not conduct the inspection without the necessary approval from the department. This is despite legislation permitting members of portfolio committee to conduct inspections unhindered. The members spent most of the morning on the phone with the department and social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, who allegedly still barred the members from performing their duties. Khanyile said the head of the institution refused to speak to them and put the MEC on speaker who simply referred the members to the head of communications who denied them access. She said as a result the members would utilise all mechanisms available to them in parliament, the national assembly and legislature.  “We are going to draft a report to submit to the chairperson of the social development portfolio as we want to know where the money is. As it is we saw some of the children wearing flip flops in this cold weather.”
