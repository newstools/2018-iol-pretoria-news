“There are external factors beyond the control of the government. There has to be appreciation of dynamics around the acquisition of crude oil and relationships that get strained and impact negatively on the fuel price." Mokonyane said South Africans who relied on vehicles to get to work should live in areas close-by. “Those interventions that are much more inclusive can ease the burden on the end-user and the cost of living.” The Cabinet welcomed the unchanged fuel price for this month as a once-off temporary relief while other measures were being sought by the Energy Department, she said. “At a time when the economy is being impacted by global headwinds, Cabinet is pleased that this intervention has no impact on the fiscus as it uses funds that are already in the fuel pricing structure.” Mokonyane also said the government's stimulus package, aimed at boosting the country’s economic prospects, will be made public soon after its costing was concluded. “At an appropriate time pronouncements will be made by the president,” she told a post-Cabinet briefing yesterday. This as South Africa’s economy contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter after a 2.6% decline in the first quarter. Mokonyane said the Cabinet called on all sectors to rally behind the government-led initiatives. She said the upcoming job and investment summit as well as a “complete overhaul” of the visa regime and the proposed government stimulus package would provide details on reforms needed to drive growth. Mokonyane said a number of inhibiting factors had been identified. “You need a visa regime which would not necessarily put more stumbling blocks on those interested to come to South Africa. It has to be an enabler while not compromising the security of the country and vulnerable groups.”
