Her four sons have filed a document in which they list themselves as interested parties. Franklin died last week from advanced pancreatic cancer. She was 76. Franklin’s niece asked the court to appoint her as a personal representative of the estate, the Detroit Free Press reported. It said under Michigan law, if an unmarried person dies without a will, his or her assets are divided equally among any children. Franklin’s lawyer, Don Wilson, who represented her in entertainment matters for nearly three decades said he constantly asked her to do a trust, but she never got around to it. Wilson said while he didn’t have a dollar figure on the value of Franklin’s assets, the lack of a will meant the finances would become public in Oakland County Probate Court. He hoped dividing her estate would not end up being a big fight. Franklin’s funeral will be held on August 31 in Detroit and she will be entombed at Woodlawn Cemetery there. Meanwhile, Madonna has said she didn’t intend to do a tribute to Franklin at Monday’s MTV Video Music Awards. The pop star was scorched online for telling a lengthy story about Franklin that had more to do with herself than the Queen of Soul. But in an Instagram post on Tuesday, Madonna said she was asked to present the video of the year award and share any anecdotes she had in her career that were connected to Franklin. Madonna’s story was about singing a song popularised by Franklin during an audition. She wrote that she could never do Franklin justice with a tribute amid the noise and tinsel of an award show.
