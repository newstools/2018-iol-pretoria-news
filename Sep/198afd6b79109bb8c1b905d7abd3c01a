Pretoria - Learners at an illegally run school in Raslouw, Centurion could be seen jumping over the gate as parents came to collect them. This after Gauteng Education officials came to shut down Centauri Dual Medium Private High School for operating illegally and non-compliance with an order to close down the independent school. Upon arrival at the smallholding the school utilises, officials were barred entry and had to go and open a case with the Wierdabrug police. Education spokesperson, Steve Mabona, said the school had approached the Tshwane South District office in 2016, requesting to be registered as an examination centre for the NSC examination. He said however, their request was declined due to issues related to non-compliance in terms of grade 10 and 11 promotion schedules.

"It must be noted that there is a threat to the continuation of provision of education services by the owner of the school." "The Department of Education has therefore acted in compliance with the prescripts of the policy regulating the registration and withdrawal of registration of independent schools and the mandate that quality education is provided to learners in all our schools. Some of the neighbours also complained about problems of the learners teasing the dogs and loitering. Pretoria News
