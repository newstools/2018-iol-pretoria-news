MATLHATSI DIBAKWANE Fortunate 200 children aged 12 to 17 years from Mamelodi, Soshanguve, Mabopane and Atteridgeville had an opportunity to experience being part of Wakanda and to know how it feels to see a superhero who looks exactly like them, at Sterland. Tshimollo media donated R5 000 to the challenge #BlackPantherChallengeSA to watch one of the most important superhero movies to date, Black Panther. Founder of the media company Mamahlatse Marokane said the pupils were chosen for their smart minds but the mistake people have been making is underestimating the power of entertainment on young minds. She said it was important for them to identify with people who are black and able. She said they want the young people to realise that their dreams matter, they are beautiful and should never strive to be approved or accepted by the world. “They should love and follow their dreams just like the movie predicts for people of colour. This will be an experience they will never forget because some of the children don't know the inside of a cinema. They will also get to experience and see South African actors and actresses,” she said. She added it was a lesson that will make them happy. Excited after the movie Lebogang Kekana from Soshanguve said it was the best movie he had ever seen. Amazed he said: "It taught me be resilient, respect my elders but also be there for my people. Black is beautiful and amazing, I got to see the beauty of our people in this movie," he said.
