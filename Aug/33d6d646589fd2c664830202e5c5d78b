Thousands of old vehicles were exhibited by the Pretoria Old Motor Club. The theme for this year was American Cars. A 1902 Curved Dash Oldsmobile, believed to be the oldest running car in the country, was also the oldest car on display. Its exhibitor, who asked not to be named, said this was the first best-selling American car of the 20th century. He said the vehicle was still running to this day because he looked after it. “If something is expensive, you make sure that you look after it and that is the reason I still have this car today.” Event organiser Frik Kraamwinkel said this year marked 39 years of the event being staged. He said it was the 11th year the event was held at Zwartkops. “We used to host the event in Silverton, but as the years went by it became bigger, hence we moved here,” he said. The event saw 120 clubs exhibiting more than 2500 cars. Kraamwinkel said the day was more of a family occasion than a gathering for motor heads. He said while car lovers went on to view the old vehicles, children had various play stations.
