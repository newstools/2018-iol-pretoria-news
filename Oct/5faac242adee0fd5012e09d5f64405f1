They were chosen from the Top 100 identified by the GradStar programme, now in its third year. But it was Kirsten Dempsey, Bernice Mabaya, Michelle Oelofse and Roger Wyllie who put the capital city on the map. The Top 100 students were selected based on leadership criteria and readiness for the workplace in addition to academic performance. The programme culminates in employer workshops with the Top 100, who represent the financial, accounting, IT, engineering and legal disciplines, among others. Patron David Molapo said the programme was designed to uplift student youth at this time of unrest and provide an aspirational platform to assist them in achieving their potential. The Top 100 will each be connected with a business mentor, recognised through the Rising Star Programme.
