The DA will partner with the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), the City of Tshwane, religious groups and the Tshwane taxi industry to march to the National Treasury against the high fuel cost. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said all concerned South African citizens and organisations were invited to gather at Church Square, Pretoria, next week Tuesday to partake in the demonstration. The marchers will hand over a memorandum demanding the reduction of the fuel levy from R5.33 by at least R1 or 20%. This could hopefully reduce the petrol price from the "bitter" R16 to just under R15. Maimane said there was lack of political will from the ANC-led government to help reduce the prices of fuel and the "unwanted" 15% VAT. Maimane said the government was simply blaming the high price on international markets which affect the oil price and the value of the rand although it had a role to play with regard to the levies.

He said South Africa had the highest cost of petrol in the entire Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. He said this showed that the South African government failed to take measures to keep fuel prices as low as possible. He said motorists, public transport commuters and business people in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia paid less for petrol than South Africans because they did not have to pay high fuel levies. Maimane said the South African fuel levy was a government cash cow. The DA leader slammed the Road Accident Fund (RAF) and called it an incompetent beneficiary of a portion of the fuel levy. The panel made a call to all concerned citizens to spread the word and help attract hundreds or thousands of people to the City centre to join in the march.
