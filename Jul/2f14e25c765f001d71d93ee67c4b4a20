The area where the discovery was made had been set on fire. A community member, who asked not to be named, said she heard in the early morning that a baby had been dumped. “You can see it was a beautiful baby boy. He was put in a bread plastic bag. The way he was badly burnt you could see the baby struggled before he died.” The residents said they suspected the culprit dumped the baby and then set the place on fire in a bid to hide the evidence. Shocked bystanders wondered who could have abandoned the body in the bush. Some could not hold back their anger as they stood in groups talking about the matter. “The police must find the mother who did this, it is such an awful and painful thing to do to a baby. They must catch her and throw away the key,” a fuming resident said. Police are investigating.
