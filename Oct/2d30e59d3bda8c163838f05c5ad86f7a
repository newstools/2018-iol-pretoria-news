The managing director of SA Rooibos Jacques Bester said: "We are a turn-key source, packer and exporter of South African herbal teas to the world and our company specialises not only in offering the refreshing rooibos and honeybush tea under our own trademark, but we offer it as a private label as well."    Bester added that their rooibos company has been operating for 20 years and employs 50 people. The company is exporting their products to countries like Japan, South-Korea, Germany and the Netherlands. It also intends to export to France soon. According to the managing director, their establishment’s target clientele is mainly grocery chains, distributors and importers. He attributes the company's strength to the fact that they aim to offer a value-added, superior finished product to the market. Rooibos and honeybush, the sweeter tasting sibling of Rooibos, are inimitable products and are indigenous to South Africa and are gaining popularity as speciality teas across the globe. Rooibos and honeybush grow wild and are derived from the native fynbos, which only grows in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape and also the Cederberg Mountains, the Cape Peninsula and Port Elizabeth.
