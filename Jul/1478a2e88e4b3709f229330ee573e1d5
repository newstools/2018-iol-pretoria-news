The march, which culminated with the delivery of a memorandum delivered at the Union Buildings, was supported by the wheelchair-bound, partially blind and deaf. The memorandum called on the Department of Basic Education to give pupils with albinism an opportunity to access mainstream schools, and not those for children with special needs. The group also called for the Department of Justice and Correctional Services and other legal entities to impose harsher sentences on those found guilty of killing, raping and other “de-humanising” and criminal acts against people with albinism. Tassie Foundation chairperson Bruce Sithole said people with albinism suffered a lot, and the government had been excluding them in many sectors. Debbie Sebola, who was at the march, said mass action was against action stretching from killings to ugly stares and name-calling in the direction of people with albinism. “We hope this will create awareness that we are also people like everyone else, and that the public needs to stop being mean to us.” Annah Mojapelo said: “People must transfer this knowledge to their children because we are called names by little children. I hope that the awareness goes to the roots, and that even the smallest child will know that people with albinism are normal.” Mojapelo said it was difficult for parents to take their children to mainstream schools because they wanted to shield them from being victimised. Damaris Sithole said people with albinism had to fight to be accommodated everywhere. She said even essentials such as sunscreens were not covered in their medical aid.
