The exhibition draws material from the Nelson Mandela Exhibition on display at Kilmainham Goal in Ireland. It is made up of a series of panels which explore the relationship between the countries, dating back to support of the Irish for the anti-apartheid movement. It also looks at the role of South African leaders, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, in the Northern Ireland peace process. This exhibition celebrates the shared history and values that have built the close cultural, trading and political relationship that Ireland and South Africa enjoy today, according to the embassy. It is open daily from 7am to 6pm until October 30 and entrance is free. Staff Reporter
