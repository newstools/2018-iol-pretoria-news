Marchers from organisations across Tshwane, escorted by a phalanx of police cadets, took part in this morning’s #100MenMarch. The march, organised by the Government Communications, GCIS, and involving government departments, the City of Tshwane, NGOs, the legal fraternity and religious leaders, marked the start of a new campaign to end violence against women and children. Inspired by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s “Thuma Mina” (or send me) campaign - and commemorating the lives of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu, the #100MenMarch followed along Madiba Street to the lawns of the Union Buildings. GCIS’s Phumla Williams said the #100MenMarch urges South Africans to join a movement for positive change by standing up against violence and abuse and working together for positive change.

Marchers from GCIS wore bibs with the message “Send Me to build the Mzansi (South Africa) I want”. Social activist Yusuf Abrambjee teamed up with the Pretoria News in support of the march, and 100 T-shirts bearing the #PretoriaNews120 and #MakeSASafe logos - with the message “Stop violence against women and children” - were given out to marchers who also held up newspaper posters calling for an end to abuse. Outside the Pretoria News, marchers could add their signature to a pledge board. The pledge reads: “I pledge to help end the culture of silence that accompanies violence and abuse. I pledge not to commit violence and to act when I see violence against women and children. I pledge to teach those in my care the values of human dignity, equality and respect Pretoria News
