The Moretele Tribute Concert had music lovers packing the venue from as early as 11am, while cars filled the streets. It had all the ingredients of a spectacular music concert - from breathtaking fireworks, excellent lighting and sound, and the star studded line-up, which had Sjava as well as legends Caiphus Semenya, Letta Mbulu, Ringo and Tshepo Tshola. Mafikizolo, Don Laka, Amanda Black, Vusi Nova, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Encore and Sun EL were also there. Not even the cold weather late at night could deter the crowdâ€™s feisty spirit. Iconic couple Bra Caiphus and Mam Letta reminded revellers why they had dominated the music industry, and still continue to do so, by giving an electrifying performance that took folks down memory lane. Ladysmith Black Mambazo put the cherry on top, with their agile moves and manoeuvres. In addition to the concert, Moretele Park was also celebrating 20 years. Once a feeder dairy and vegetable farm for the Bothgotsong Old Age Home, Moretele Park used to be called Vlakfontein. The farm keeper was Mr Modau, which prompted Mamelodi D residents to call it Ga-Modau.
