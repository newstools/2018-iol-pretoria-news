The Trailfinders garden designed by Jonathan Snow, is divided into three sections going from wild Cape fynbos to cultivated garden outside a miniature Cape Dutch homestead. The winner of the Best Show garden at the annual Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) event in England was Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley Garden for the NSPCC. His garden, designed for the children’s charity, portrays a child’s emotional transition from confused to a tranquil open space. Other winning gardens included the Urban Flow Garden and the Hospitality Garden - O-mo-te-na-shi no NIWA  - designed by Kazuyuki Ishihara which won the Artisan Gold award. The SA National Biodiversity Institute team at the show won South Africa’s 35th gold medal and a President’s Award. With its theme Windows on Biodiversity, the circular exhibit with its backdrop of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden and Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden was designed by David Davidson and Raymond Hudson who were responsible for designing and creating the Kirstenbosch-South Africa exhibit for the show for 23 consecutive years. On display are plants that represent all 10 of South Africa’s National Botanical Gardens, including that in Pretoria, alongside iconic symbols like windmills. The plant of the year - in which new varieties never before seen at a flower show compete - went to Hydrangea Runaway Bride Snow White, with the dramatic “Blue Waves” second and Sunbelievable Brown Eyed Girl third. The Chelsea Flower Show draws 150000 visitors to the grounds of the Royal Hospital over five days. It ends on Saturday.
