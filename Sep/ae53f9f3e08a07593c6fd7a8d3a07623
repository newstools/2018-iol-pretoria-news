In 2015, he launched his solo career with the release of Toe Vind Ek Jou featuring Karen Zoid. To celebrate his life and music, Van Coke is hosting a rock show at Sun Arena Time Square on Saturday, showcasing his collaborations with nine artists with whom he has crafted some of the most memorable South African songs. The backbone of the two-hour show will be Van Coke with his band Die Gevaar performing various songs from his solo career. During the show his friends will join him on stage to perform the anthems they created together, as well as hits from their own catalogue. Expect a party. Tickets from R225 (standing) at Computicket.
