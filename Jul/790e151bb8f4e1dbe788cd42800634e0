Pretoria - A cleric who was attacked and shot by robbers in his Pretoria home succumbed to his wounds the following day. Pastor Jackson Makaneta of Church of Christ in New Eersterust’s murder follows that of Reverend Nico Rautenbach, who was badly assaulted during a house robbery in Garsfontein on the morning of July 8, while preparing for a service. Makaneta died after doctors failed to remove a bullet stuck in his stomach. The tragedy occurred three days after he celebrated his 52nd birthday. His nephew, Hendrick Makaneta, he was asleep with family when thieves broke into their home. He went to investigate and came across three armed men. “They said they wanted dagga, but my uncle said they didn’t sell dagga. But they were adamant that they had bought dagga at the house the previous day,” he said. Hendrick said there was a house near Makaneta’s home known to sell dagga; he suspected the robbers had entered the wrong house. When the robbers heard there was no dagga, they took cellphones and a laptop. Makaneta tried to fight them off and was shot in the thigh and stomach. The bullet to the stomach caused his death as doctors could not remove it. “My uncle was good man and always jolly. The community loved him because he counselled families going through the worst. These people not only robbed the family of a breadwinner, a loving father, husband and uncle, but also a community builder,” he said. Hendrick called on citizens to assist in the search for the criminals and the police to prioritise on the case. Police Captain Sarah Lesabane said investigations were under way. Rautenbach, the Afrikaanse Protestantse Kerk reverend was admitted to the ICU at the Pretoria East Hospital, with concussion, bleeding on the brain, a broken nose and bruises over his body. He spent two weeks in hospital and was now recovering at home. His wife Elsie said Rautenbach did not undergo any operation, but he now seemed confused and had short-term memory. Pretoria News
