American rapper, songwriter and television personality Snoop Dogg on Monday received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - three days before the 25th anniversary of his debut album "Doggystyle." The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” hit singer (real name Calvin Broadus) celebrated the honour by thanking himself during the ceremony attended by his family, fellow rappers and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, record producer Quincy Jones and more. “I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work, I want to thank me for having no days off, I want to thank me for never quitting, I want to thank me for always being a giver, and trying to give more than I receive, I want to thank me for doing more right than wrong, I want to thank me for being me at all times,” he said during the ceremony. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by rapper and entrepreneur Dr Dre. The rapper has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide. The 47-year-old father of four also published his first cookbook, “From Crook to Cook,” last month. His fans have since taken to Instagram and Twitter to congratulate the rapper.
