Speaking during the programme, Police Minister Bheki Cele said: “This day should be everyday.

"We want you to have a feel and understand what it is about. He also encouraged women to not stay in abusive relationships. “If women say no, it must be no. When these women come battered, bruised and bloodied to police stations, don't send them home to negotiate because you will be sending them to their death,” he told the crowd. “Women take care of yourselves. Any man who points a finger at you, walk away. Don't ever stay with any man who abuses you,” he said. Marchers have now dispersed. Pretoria News
