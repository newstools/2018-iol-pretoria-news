This is not only for the aesthetical value, but also because of the ecological importance thereof. Also joining the initiative was the City of Tshwane, planting five indigenous trees (the Yellowwood - tree of the year, Common Karee Species and River Bush Willow) at Tshwane South College, Odi Campus, in Mabopane. In addition to the trees, 55 recycling bins were donated to the college to boost recycling. MMC for Agriculture and Environment Mike Mkhari told students that they could even turn trash into cash. “It happens every day. Every day people earn either hundreds of rand or some spare money on the side, from waste. Some even decide to make this a full-time income source,” he said. Mkhari said instead of living in a pigsty, students should make the trash work for them. “Trash has the ability to create indirect jobs. People you look down on who push trolleys full of waste and plastic bottles, are in fact playing a vital part in cleaning up the environment.” The students were all ears as they received a crash course on the benefits of recycling and keeping the environment green and litter-free. The launch was part of the City’s marking National Arbor Month. This year’s Arbor Month is celebrated under the theme “Forests and Sustainable Cities” and aims to promote investment in green spaces to help transform cities into more sustainable, resilient, healthy, equitable and pleasant places. Mkhari said illegal dumping remained a thorn in the flesh for the City. “Separate trash at source to prevent tons of waste being thrown at every corner of the street.” Campus manager Simon Masango said the trees and bins would go a long way to ensuring a healthier and clean environment and in turn create a suitable learning environment.
