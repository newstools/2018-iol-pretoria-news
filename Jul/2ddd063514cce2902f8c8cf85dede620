The discussion, to be held at Loft at Nine in Menlo Park tomorrow morning, will feature several speakers, among them Professor Thuli Madonsela, life coach and author Kofi Ofori-Boateng, and actor Zane Meas. The discussion is aimed at bringing healing about fatherless, and awareness about the silent killer to the public. Pietersen said, having grown up without a father, he knew of the anger and hatred men had in them if they grew up without a father figure in their lives. He looked for his father at the age of 21. Sadly, his father died two years after they'd met but they had already made peace. Pietersen said people, both men and women, were sitting with a lot of hatred and anger and were in need of closure. The absence of fathers and father-figures was the root cause of a lot of things in this country, he said. “These days you find a woman with three children and each child has his/her own father. Should there have been a father figure in their lives, these girls would have known that they were loved by their fathers and did not have to believe every man who comes into their lives and feeds them lies. “We have witnessed a lot of femicide cases in the country. If you check the background of these men, you will see that they mostly come from single mother households or no-parent households.” Pietersen said the platform was to encourage the public to go back to basics and get fathers back in their families. Former public protector Madonsela would look into the issue from a woman’s and mother’s point of view. Thereafter the panel would come up with a way forward. Tickets are R200.
