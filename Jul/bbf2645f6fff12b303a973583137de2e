Pretoria - Tshwane council meeting had to be paused this morning after EFF members refused to continue with the programme of council until a consensus was reached about the venue selected for a land debate. The EFF was not happy that Tshwane residents were expected to debate on the issue of land at the Lucus van der Berg Hall located in Pretoria West. Fighters said first the venue was too small for Tshwane's population as it could only accommodate approximately 200 people at the same time. They also argued that the venue was located in a predominantly Afrikaans community and that would enable AfriForum members to camp outside the venue prior to the debate. Tshwane speaker, councillor Katlego Mathebe, struggled to convince the councillors that the venue was recommended by parliament and not the City. However, EFF members were insistent that the venue was recommended by the City of Tshwane. This prompted Mathebe to send someone to print out proof that the venue was not selected by the DA-led administration. Mayor Solly Msimanga then stood and requested an adjournment for a brief caucus between multi-party leaders. They discussed the issue of the venue and established that the City did not recommend the small venue. Msimanga told members that the City also expressed concerns about the small venue and further took administrative steps to help find a bigger venue to accommodate a larger audience. Council members are still debating the land issue and have not started with items on the programme. Pretoria News
