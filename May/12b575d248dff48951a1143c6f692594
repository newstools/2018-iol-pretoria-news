Moseneke announced on February after concluding the arbitration process for families of the psychiatric patients who died in the Life Esidimeni saga that he would donate his legal fees to law schools. "I hope this will help nurture young women and men committed to defending the vulnerable against the abuse of the high and mighty," he said. "On Monday, at a ceremony attended by university rector Professor Tyrone Pretorius,  Moseneke committed around R400000 to law students who excelled in their final year of their LLB and LLM degrees," the university said. "In turn, the university pledged to match Moseneke's donation to assist in promoting excellence within the law faculty." Moseneke said the university was one of the three he had chosen to donate to. "I hope to encourage young people from the Western Cape in particular to assume their role in continuing to be socially conscious lawyers who will continue to uphold the rule of law and social justice," he said. â€œThe target of this is excellence; it is not a bursary. This is to identify and encourage excellence, hard work and commitment to achieve outstanding results." In February, he ordered that each family of the Life Esidimeni victims receive R1million in compensation from the government. The patients' transfer to ill-equipped NGOs in 2015 and 2016 resulted in many dying from hunger, cold, dehydration and general lack of care. - African News Agency (ANA)
