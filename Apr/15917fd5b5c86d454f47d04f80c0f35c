GREEN by day and multi-coloured by night – that’s Pretoria’s signature Time Square development which has now been completed with the opening of the Maslow Hotel. The hotel is the last part of the R4 billion development by Sun International which is part of the broader Menlyn Maine Green City, where the Trilogy Collection, three blocks with more than 500 upmarket flats, is being built around a parkland. When complete, Menlyn Maine will occupy 315  000m², and be the largest mixed-use precinct in the capital. It consists of the Menlyn Maine Central Square, Capital hotel, restaurants, shops and offices on the northern side of Aramist Street, and Time Square with the casino and convention centre, the Sun Arena and now the 17-storey Maslow Time Square to the south. The casino – second biggest in South Africa , with 18 bars and restaurants – opened last April and the Arena opened in September. Already the Arena, with seating for 8  500, has hosted a number of local and international acts, with WWE wrestling on Friday, The Script performing on May 4 followed by British magician Dynamo from May 11-13. The hotel, with the latest technology, offers 238 rooms and suites for leisure and business travellers, from three-to five-star facilities in the same building. It has a business lounge and 13 conference rooms. The hotel is served by Tatso restaurant, a lounge bar and a pool bar looking out over Menlyn Maine. An exclusive Solis bar on the zenith level presents stunning views over the eastern city.
