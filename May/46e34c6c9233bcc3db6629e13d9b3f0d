Both masters and novices of drinking whisky gathered at Menlyn Park Shopping Centre on the day meteorologists said would probably be the last warm weather of the season. They tasted, sipped, and bought bottles from the producers of the liquid gold. Held under cover in one of the newly renovated parkades, the event was lauded as the best way to toast the end of the warm weather and welcome the winter. Men and women, young and old mixed and mingled with those who knew their whisky and those who had no clue of the right flavour or accompaniment for their moods, and indulged their senses in the luxury offerings from local distillers and from those that were brewed 
abroad. Whisky Live Pretoria was launched on Thursday night, and saw the organisers taking beverages and their makers from Cape Town to the capital city. From here, they will take the show to Durban and allow the general population there to understand that whisky is the way of the world. - Ntando Makhubu
