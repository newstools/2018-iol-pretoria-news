Roux has just returned from Lausanne, Switzerland, where he trained for 10 days at the Archery Academy of Excellence. He trained under the supervision of a former Spanish Olympian medallist and a Korean coach who won medals at the Junior World Championships. “We trained for about four to five hours each day. It really helped to have such experienced coaches on hand who are able to point out when you make a mistake immediately,” said Roux. “They were also continually giving us tips as to the do’s and don’ts of competing in a major competition. “Getting to learn from the best helped me to believe in my abilities,” said the Grade 10 pupil from Hoërskool Menlopark. “I am certainly not going to Argentina just to make up the numbers. If I can keep my cool and remain focused I could be in contention to medal. Archery is all about confidence. “You are bound to shoot one or two bad arrows. The secret is not to let it get to you. If you do it is game over.” - African News Agency (ANA)
