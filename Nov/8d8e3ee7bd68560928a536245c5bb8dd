Former first lady Dr Bongi Ngema-Zuma said 80% of the causes of this type of diabetes were preventable by eating healthy and exercising. “There are over 600 000 children from 0 to 14 years who are living with Type 1 diabetes. These people need to be helped with ways to manage diabetes.” She was speaking during a diabetes awareness campaign hosted by the Bongi Ngema-Zuma Foundation at the Favors Cathedral Church in Pretoria on Saturday. “The campaign encourages people living with the disease and those who may not be aware of their status to constantly screen and to commit to a healthy lifestyle that involves good nutrition and exercise,” she said. The event took place a week before World Diabetes Day, marked on November 14. This year’s theme is Family and Diabetes. The day kick-started with aerobics and a 3km walk. Activities also included stations for screenings and testing of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and HIV/Aids, as well as pap smears and circumcisions. Ngema-Zuma said they held the campaign prior to World Diabetes Day because the church hosted a conference for its branches over the weekend. “We decided that since different branches will be gathered here, we will screen the people so that they know where they stand with regards to their health.” Many queued to be tested and screened, and among them was Tryphina Diphoko, 38, from Limpopo. She said the initiative was a good idea as many did not voluntarily go to clinics and hospitals to get screened and tested. “This is an opportunity for us to know our health status because everything is here,” Diphoko said. We don’t have an excuse that we don’t have money to travel to clinics or hospitals,” she said. “I am scared to do this, but I must know my status because my family has a history of diabetes. I spend a lot of my time on the computer, I will also do eye tests.”
