JOHANNESBURG -Â The rand traded somewhat weaker versus the greenback during European trade on Friday. The South African currency traded in a narrow range but surrendered some recent gains due to broad US dollar strength. On the data front, better-than-expected South African merchandise trade balance data for August offered the currency some support. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.4 percent weaker at R14.14/$, after trading in the range of R14.08/$ - R14.26/$. The rand traded flat this morning. Expected range today R14.05/$ - R14.35/$.
