Power was off between 6pm and 8pm in Derdepoort, Môregloed, Kilner Park, Queenswood, Waverley, East Lynne, Silverton, Jan Niemand Park, Elardus Park, Wingate Park, Rietvallei, Erasmuskloof, Monument Park, Sterrewag, Moreleta Park and Waterkloof Ridge. Mayor Solly Msimanga tweeted that the city had been put on a load-shedding alert. “Eskom requires a capacity saving of 600MW to be shed. This is as a result of Eskom not being able to generate the required capacity due to industrial action." Load-shedding did not only affect the capital, but was rolled out countrywide. Earlier, about 1000 union members picketed outside Eskom’s Megawatt Park headquarters in Sandton, over a wage dispute. Up until yesterday there had been no forced cuts, but Eskom said some plants had cut output, with shortages more likely now during peak winter demand. Unions have threatened a total shutdown of Eskom’s operations unless it meets their demands for a 15% increase in salaries. The pickets come a day after protests at about 10 Eskom power plants forced the utility to switch off some generating units, because trucks carrying coal and buses ferrying staff were blockaded. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said that some power stations were not generating at full capacity, because of “acts of sabotage and intimidation”. See Business Report
