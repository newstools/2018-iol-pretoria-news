The quiz is brought to you by the Pretoria News and is sponsored by Varsity College. It is open to all high schools in the Pretoria area. Teams must consist of four pupils from Grades 9 to 11, with two teams allowed per school. Each team should have an adult mentor - such as a teacher or parent. The quiz is focused on current affairs, politics, sport, business and entertainment and participants who follow the news in the Pretoria News in the run-up to the event will have a distinct advantage. The winning team from Pretoria will get R20000 for their school and a bursary from Varsity College to offer to a deserving pupil, while the team members will get R2000 each. This team will represent the capital city in the national quiz final in Joburg in September. The winning team gets a further R20000 for their school, with R5000 going to each team member. Entries for the quiz close on June 22. To enter please e-mail pnquiz@inl.co.za. - Staff Reporter
