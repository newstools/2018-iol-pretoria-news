The others include National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson Thandi Modise, Thoko Didiza the National Assembly house chairperson for internal arrangements, Mandlesizwe Zwelivelile Mandela, and Santosh Vinita Kalyan. They are replacing Hunadi Mateme, Thandi Memela, Charles Nqakula, and Floyd Shivambu, while Kalyan will serve another two-year term, the parliament said. The five MPs were nominated for membership of the Pan African Parliament on behalf of the South African Parliament by the NA and the NCOP on October 24 and 23 respectively. After the swearing in Malema said the Pan African Parliament need to have “teeth” to be able to tackle errant governments on the continent to ensure they follow democratic principles and tackle corruption. The theme for the session - from yesterday until May 18 - was “Winning the fight against corruption: A sustainable path to Africa's 
transformation”. Among others, the session will discuss, recommend, and take resolutions on matters including the Europe-Africa Forum on the challenges and opportunities of migration flows; the report on the African Union (AU) year of combating corruption; the report on action on albinism in Africa; the terminal report of the committee on audit and public accounts; and the report on repealing defamation laws to promote press freedom. The Pan African Parliament has 255 members representing 55 AU member states that had ratified the protocol establishing it. In terms of the protocol to the treaty establishing the African Economic Community relating to the PAP, each state would be represented by five members. The five members from each country should include at least one woman and reflect the diversity of political representation in the national parliament or deliberative organ, parliament said. - African News Agency (ANA)
