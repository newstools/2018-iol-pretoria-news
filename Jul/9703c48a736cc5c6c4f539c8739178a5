Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager said Bombela had on July 17 offered an increase of 7% across the board (on basic salary and allowances), plus medical aid contribution of 50%, plus a collective bonus target of R8000 per employee per year (which equates to an overall increase of the bargaining unit of 8.6%). Alternatively, an increase of 8.5% across the board (on basic salary and allowances), plus medical aid contribution of 55% but without a bonus (equating to an overall increase of the bargaining unit of 8.4%). “The union is demanding an increase of 10% on basic salary plus an increase of 113% on housing allowance (from R750 to R1 600), plus a new transport allowance of R800 for non-shift workers, plus an increase of 101% on night work transport subsidy (from R31.84 to R64 per shift), plus a 10% increase on night shift allowance, plus a medical aid contribution at 55/45, and a R20000 bonus per employee per year (equating to an overall increase of the bargaining unit of 19.6%),” said Nayager. Bombela remained open to further talks via the CCMA, hopeful a settlement could be reached before the planned strike commenced. Bombela had requested a meeting with the union today. On Tuesday the union gave Bombela 48 hours notice members would embark on a protected strike over wages. - African News Agency (ANA)
