“We are a democracy and respect the rights of all citizens to express their wishes to a democratically elected government. What we will never support as the ANC is for some public servants to demand that our premier be removed as head of government,” said acting provincial secretary Susanna Dantjie. On Tuesday, members of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), the Democratic Nursing Organisation of SA (Denosa) and the Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of SA (Hospersa) marched to the provincial legislature demanding that Mahumapelo resign as premier within 14 days. Dantjie said they applauded Mahumapelo for his ongoing pronouncement against corruption since 2014. He must intensify the programme against greed, crime and corruption, she said. “All the forensic investigations must be acted upon speedily and additional investigations done irrespective of who is involved,” she said. “It is the directive of the ANC national conference to intensify the fight against greed, crime and corruption on all fronts. We expect all public representatives to act in an exemplary manner” The ANC called on its members at the legislature to vote against a motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo, brought by the EFF and set to be debated on April 17. “The ANC cannot allow opposition parties to set the agenda for us.” - African News Agency (ANA)
