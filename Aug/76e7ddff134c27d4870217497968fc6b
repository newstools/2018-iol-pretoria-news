However, they did not make their way to the Union Buildings, but rather to a spot near the Pretoria Arts Museum in Arcadia where they gathered near the giant megaphone they had placed there in February. Accompanied by their female teachers and school governing body, pupils used the megaphone as a platform to empower each other. They read out poems and sang, showing unity among women. Their Afrikaans teacher and local artist, Lira van Staden, was the one who designed the megaphone sculpture, placed at the park in front of the museum. Van Staden said the megaphone was an interactive sculpture that was a symbol to give the public a voice. “There are actually two megaphones, the other one is in Magnolia Dell. They are meant to cross the diversity gap between people living in the suburbs and those in the city,” she said. In the midst of the pupils was the great-granddaughter of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Anelisa Madikizela, who also attends Pretoria Tech. The 15-year-old said the new generation deemed the 1956 march unimportant. She said even convincing her peers to take part in the march was difficult. “What those women did in 1956 is very close to my heart, and the history of my great-grandmother and how she was oppressed empowered me to do more and strive to be like her. “Our generation does not understand that those women were the reason we are here today. “And we need to keep their legacy alive,” she said. She said to this day, women were still fighting for their place in the country, schools included. “We still have to fight to be recognised as females in schools. “For instance, there is only rugby and soccer for male pupils. “We have been trying to talk to the school since last year that we also want female rugby and soccer teams. Rugby is the only sport taken seriously; netball and other feminine sports are not,” she said. The day included the reading of poems, and singing.
