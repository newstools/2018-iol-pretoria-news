The passionate volunteers give their time and skills to assist full -time rangers and staff at bush camps and in anti-poaching education and conservation campaigns across regions, including the Kruger National Park, northern parks, Garden Route, frontier parks, Cape parks and South Africa’s arid parks. The 1600 honorary rangers across the country raise awareness and do fund-raising for projects in the parks, providing invaluable assistance. A relaxed event at the Pretoria Botanical Gardens on Saturday exposed the public to some of the rangers’ activities, as well as those of organisations in local nature protection - such as those who help take care of Moreleta Kloof and Faerie Glen nature reserves and the waterways of the Moreleta Spruit, the Society for Animals in Distress and Birdlife South Africa. There were informative talks and activities for the Young Rangers, including a treasure hunt and nature quiz. - Staff Reporter
