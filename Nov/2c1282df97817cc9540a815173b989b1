Executive mayor Solly Msimanga, who also took part, said he was pleased to see that the event was growing. “Last year we saw the participation of about 5000 cyclists and I was told that we had 8000 in totality this year. “This is one of the big events on the City calendar and we want to ensure that we can compete with the likes of the Cape Town Cycle Tour. “It looks like we are heading in that direction as we now have a number of people from Europe taking part,” he said. Msimanga opened the event and also participated in the 20km race. He said the Tshwane Classic was more than just a race, but rather a family fun day as families spent their day cycling. The event was also aimed to promote an alternative, healthy lifestyle, he said. “We have township groups such as Mamelodi riders, a group from Hammanskraal and another from Atteridgeville and some members of these groups are former drug addicts who have taken on cycling as an alternative. We also want to see people move more towards using an alternative mode of transport such as cycling. “We have started with bicycle lanes in certain parts of the city such as Hatfield, Sunnyside and we are also constructing bicycle lanes in Mamelodi,” Msimanga said. Participants varied from young and old to professionals and amateurs. While the professionals raced long distances, others chose distances best suited to them. The race started and ended at the Voortrekker Monument, and participants cycled past some of the historical landmarks of the city.
