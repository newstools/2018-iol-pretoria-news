Spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the vehicle on a trailer looked like a consignment of snacks. “Police were busy with routine duties along the N1, south of Polokwane, when they stopped a Toyota Hilux towing a trailer, after receiving information about a stolen vehicle. As the police searched the vehicle and its trailer; unpacking the snacks and removing the foil, a grey Ford Ranger was found,” said Ngoepe. It was reported stolen in Gauteng. The two suspects, aged 30 and 40, will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on charges of possession of a stolen vehicle. - African News Agency (ANA)
