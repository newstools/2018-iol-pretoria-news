Morula View residents in Mabopane can rest assured that the City would evict land grabbers who erected shacks on an open space inside the mortgage paying community. This was revealed by MMC for Agriculture and Environment Management, Mike Mkhari, to the Pretoria News. Mkhari had a meeting with the aggrieved community last week after the community clashed with land invaders who came from Boikhutsong. He visited the community last night to apologise for delays in the evictions of the unwanted settlers after missing a deadline to evict the shacks by the end of this week. The Morula View residents said the shacks would depreciate the value of their houses and provide criminals with a hiding spot. The shacks were built on a space about the size of a community park, and near a couple of double storey houses. Mkhari said the process would start in Morula View from September 1 but will be rolled out to other invaded areas. Mkhari said these evictions would only target those people who had occupied land illegally when they knew they shouldn’t have lived there. He said the City was informed about all the areas invaded and people did not need to report areas for evictions. ANC ward councillor Tshepo Motaung said the community accepted Mkhari’s apology for the delay because he had committed himself and when the promise could not be satisfied, he came to speak to them in person.
