Former Springbok hooker and Cheetahs coach Naka Drotské is reportedly in a stable condition after being shot three times during a home invasion on Thursday night. The South African rugby community was rocked by the news on Friday that Drotské had been rushed to hospital in a critical state. However, it's since emerged that his status has improved and that he is stable in hospital. "From what we hear it is stable and they think it is okay," Cheetahs CEO Harold Verster told Sport24 on Friday. According to reports, Drotské and legendary former Bok prop Os du Randt were at the house of Drotské’s brother, Thinus, in Kameeldrif, when armed robbers stormed in and began shooting. Drotské was allegedly the most seriously wounded when he was shot in the arm and chest as he sought to protect his family. News24 reports that he lost "almost a third of his blood". Some reports also suggested that Drotské was involved in a car accident as he was being rushed to a hospital, but that he managed to get to the destination in the end. "I had a chat with Os this morning. He is okay. He said it was like a war zone with shots going off everywhere ... he said it was chaos," Verster commented. Drotske played 26 Tests for the Springboks and formed part of the World Cup-winning team in 1995. African News Agency (ANA)
