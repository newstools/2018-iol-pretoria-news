Pretoria - MEC for the Department of Roads Ismail Vadi on Thursday morning officially opened the R55 in Laudium which was closed a few months ago due to a massive sinkhole. Vadi was joined by his City of Tshwane counterpart MMC Sheila Senkubuge and numerous officials from the City, provincial government and contractors who worked tirelessly to close the sinkhole. The sinkhole caused panic in the community when it formed, prompting urgent response and visits from premier David Makhura and mayor Solly Msimanga, who both expressed serious concerns. Community members and numerous workers from companies contracted and subcontracted to bring the sinkhole to ground level gathered inside a hall in the community's Sunrise School. Vadi said the sinkhole created an unexpected expense but government found the R12 million needed to repair it. He said the sinkhole was 30m wide and 6m deep and formed on a very important provincial road that was used by a lot of motorists, businesses and politicians like himself. "We decided to give the community of Laudium an early Christmas present by ensuring that we complete and open this road for the festive season. "We did not want our people still stressing about it during Christmas time." "I know there has been a lot of frustration here and I think we are done now. I want our people to enjoy using the road freely. I hope there won't be another sinkhole on R55." MEC Senkubuge thanked councillor Mohammed Essop for working very hard to voice the needs of the residents to government. Pretoria News
