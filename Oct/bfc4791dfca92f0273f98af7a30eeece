Pretoria - Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga on Fruday morning officially reopened the revamped Church Square after a lengthy regeneration process. The revamped Church Square took two years to complete and came at a cost of R28 million. Msimanga was joined by Roads and Transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge and her MEC counterpart Ismail Vadi for the technical presentation of the Church Square package. The new-look Church Square has already been attracting scores of people taking selfies near the statues of Paul Kruger and his generals. The precinct keeps the old, history and original feel but complements it with a more modern style and feel, restoring Church Square to its glory days.

However, City buses do use a dedicated road that takes passengers to the bus station near Church Square. The new look means the square is now paved, with new modern lighting and beautiful decorating vegetation. The construction process of course came with a fair share of challenges, seeing workers down tools numerous times over delayed salaries from their employers who were contracted by the main tender holder. However, the City always maintained that it did not owe contractors and Senkubuge had to step in to intervene so that work could resume. Pretoria News
