Among them was a group from Princess Park Secondary School, who said they were already looking forward to next year. Ngobi Sikosana, 18, who passed Grade 11, said he was over the moon. “It is going to take me a while to get used to the idea of finally ending my schooling life next year. His classmate, Hope Nkethe, 18, on the other hand said the holidays were calling. “I knew what I wanted, and I worked towards that goal. My marks reflect how hard I worked for them. “A new journey is still brewing for us for the 2019 school year and I cannot wait to take up that challenge.” Koketso Chamano, 17, said she would use the school holidays to make memories with friends and family. “When 2019 starts, I do not want to feel guilty when I give all my time to books,” Chamano said. Antoaneta Mvula completed Grade 9. She could not wait for the new year to start Grade 10. “I think for this year I should pat myself in the back for doing so well. This year was fun, even though the Natural Science subject was a challenge.” Schools will reopen on January 9.
