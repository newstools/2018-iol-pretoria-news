Pretoria - The 67 Blankets for Nelson Mandela organisation is keeping Madiba’s legacy alive with a gigantic portrait-blanket covering an area measuring more than 7 000m², so big that one will only see Madiba’s face from the sky. Members of the organisation, government officials, Department of Correctional Services officials, inmates and the Nelson Mandela Foundation gathered at the Zonderwater Maximum Correctional Centre near Cullinan to launch the masterpiece. The former president’s wife Graca Machel also attended. The largest portrait-blanket in the world pays tribute to and celebrates Madiba’s centenary year, with all blankets making up the portrait to be distributed to communities in need throughout the country. The portrait made up of more than 4 000 blankets was displayed this morning during the launch. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Founder of 67 Blankets Carolyn Steyn, said she was proud of the work inmates at the Zonderwater facility have done by creating the massive Mandela masterpiece. She also acknowledged all South Africans who made a contribution, including Jeppe Girls High; also in attendance. “I'm lost for words I'm very overwhelmed. When I came here this morning I was taken aback by how this project came about, I mean thousands of people from South Africa and other countries contributed. I really appreciate it,” she said. The very blankets used to make up the portrait will be disassembled and will be given to needy people.  rudzani.matshili@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
