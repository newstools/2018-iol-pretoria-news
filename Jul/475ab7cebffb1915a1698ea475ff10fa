Speaking at his newly-opened showroom in Gezina, Werner spoke of his father who was born to German immigrants in Pretoria. “My father was very exact and only let me tune customers'  pianos when he was satisfied with my work - and that took a few years, practising on pianos in the workshop,” he said. “My grandfather and father were also scrupulously honest. My grandfather insisted we did not need to learn to play the piano - because we would then be inclined to play to demonstrate a piano in which a customer was interested, and we would automatically play to compensate for any lack in the piano’s performance.” Werner’s grandfather worked at the Hutzelman piano factory in East Germany and later married the owner’s daughter. In 1953 Kurt immigrated with his family to South Africa. Their son, and Werner’s father, went to Germany in 1957 where 
he studied for his degree. In 1961 he fled East Germany and returned to South Africa. He opened his own business in White River before moving to Pretoria. Werner hopes to pass on the piano tuning fork to his young baby son. He and his wife Naomi adopted twin girls, Emma Nathania and Ella Gabrialla, having been told by doctors she would not be able to have children. As in so many cases, their son, Wilfried Johan (named after both their fathers), was a welcome surprise. Naomi was having chemotherapy treatment for cancer and doctors only discovered she was pregnant at four and a half months. The couple, believing music is important for people’s development often lend their expertise to schools and youth groups. They are training piano tuners. One person is retired and enjoys learning a new skill, another is planning to retire and determined to branch out into a new field. Aleck Chitono and Andrew Mnkenkana are learning the trade and enjoying every moment. The new showroom showcases not just new pianos but also antique instruments. The photographs on the walls depict the long and proud history of the family.
