A comprehensive forensic report will be handed to the public protector on Monday as part of the ongoing investigation by her office into complaints surrounding the appointment of senior officials lodged by the ANC caucus in the city. The first phase of the investigation led to the resignation of the former chief of staff in the office of the mayor, Marietha Aucamp. The city managerâ€™s office released the second phase of the findings and recommendations yesterday. It found, among other things, irregularities in the appointments of Samkelo Mgobozi, executive head: mayoral public affairs and spokesperson; Stefan Adriaan de Villiers, executive head: private office of the executive mayor; and Matthew Gerstner, who had acted as mayoral spokesperson. Mgobozi and De Villiers failed to meet the minimum criteria for their positions, and should not have been short-listed, while Gerstner was quoted as a spokesperson when not an employee of the city. Gerald Shingange, executive director: corporate and shared services, faces a disciplinary hearing for disregarding official staffing policies. Pretoria News
