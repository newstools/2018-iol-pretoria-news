They did all the singing last week in Pretoria at the State Theatre and the voting lines closed on Thursday. This means they can each hope and pray that they garnered enough votes from South Africans to crown one of them the season 14 winner. Both Sobetwa and Makape seem very relaxed. They are happy to be in the finalé and they completely comprehend that their fate isn’t in their hands, but in those of viewers. “I am looking forward to enjoying myself (tomorrow). When Proverb called my name first and said I am the first finalist, I froze. I didn’t know what to say, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, “ said an elated Sobetwa. Makape had to wait for a few seconds before his name was called on Sunday. “I wasn’t aware of the love South Africans have for me. I was so excited, I have made it to the finalé. It has been a long but beautiful journey.” This was the week the two recorded their first music videos for the singles we heard for the first time on Sunday. Sobetwa’s single is titled Scars and Makape’s single is called Blow by Blow. Idols SA supporters will not only get a chance to download the audio versions of their singles, but also will watch the videos. “I have my own music single and music video. I enjoyed the shoot of my music video. I thank God for this opportunity of being on the Idols stage,” said Sobetwa. Makape echoed her sentiments: “I am excited about the music video and the whole Idols journey. I am grateful to all the sponsors for making it possible for me to live this dream.” The million dollar question is: who will South Africa make an instant millionaire tomorrow, and whose voice will be singing joyful songs? It will be the votes of viewers that decide who wins. Who are you crowning the winner of SA Idols season 14? We find out tomorrow. Pretoria News
