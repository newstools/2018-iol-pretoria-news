More than 10000 people celebrate in true German tradition under African skies every year over the three-day event, taking place this year from today until Saturday, September 15. The Oktoberfest gives you the opportunity to experience true German hospitality with your family, friends, colleagues or clients. Taste Germany with Eisbein, Kassler, Bockwurst, Bratwurst and Schnitzel and a cold draught; hear Germany with the Bayern Stürmer Oompah band, flown in especially for the event, and celebrate Germany in the company of traditionally dressed women in Dirndl and men in Lederhosen. Entertainment for young and old at the family day from the Spielstraße for the juniors to the Mokkastube. Tickets at www.oktoberfest-pretoria.co.za/tickets!
