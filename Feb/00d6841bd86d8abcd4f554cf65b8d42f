JUST like most political parties, the political twitter zone too welcomes former President Jacob Zumaâ€™s resignation. #ZumaHasFallen, #ZumaExit, #uBaba, #ZumaResigns are still topping the trend list after having trended overnight following his resignation. Although there are mixed reactions with others saying he would be missed dearly, most expressed relief at being free of the unwanted Zuma. Zuma announced he was immediately resigning on Wednesday night. Addressing the nation on live television, Zuma said he would step down with immediate effect, even though he disagreed with the decision taken by the new ANC leadership, headed by Cyril Ramaphosa. "I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect," he said. "Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC," he said."No life should be lost in my name. And also the ANC should not be divided in my name." As the news spread that Zuma had resigned, social media users were quick to take to the platform to express how they felt. Here are some of the reactions:   I still canâ€™t believe uBaba resigned. A singer, comedian, corrupt, all in one. A man of many talents. I feel like crying ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ #ZumaHasFallen pic.twitter.com/0x4vjNvcB4  â€” Mosa Yougene Jnr (@thegenejnr) February 15, 2018
