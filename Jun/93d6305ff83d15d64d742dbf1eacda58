At least 40 pupils were invited by the Department of Education and Thunder Bay Spur to a motivational lunch at Jubilee Mall. They sat across each other, exchanging study tips and motivating each other. Oarabile Mosane, 17, from Rakgotso High School, said that what his parents went through motivated him to give his all. ”They did not have as many opportunities as I have today, and that alone makes me work hard. “I got an average of 92%, and I aim to keep it at that throughout the year. It’s so easy to be where I am but I know for other pupils it’s hard; all they have to do is get their priorities straight, know their targets and goals, never back down and keep on pushing.” Maggy Komane, 17, from Bokamoso High School, said it was her determination to be ahead that earned her a seat at the table with Hammanskraal’s best minds. “I just worked hard and even forgot there was a prize at the end, I was named the top student in the whole school. That alone makes me want to succeed more.” Yvonne Marokhu said the feeling of being among top achievers made it clear she was at the right space. “My secret is studying at school when everyone’s gone home.” The pupils were motivated by speakers, who encouraged them to keep up their great results and further prepared them mentally for their matric exams and life after school. The Hammanskraal cluster has the lunch every quarter to motivate the pupils to do even better. Cluster leader George Ngomane said: “We identified the top five pupils from each school in our circuit to encourage them to perform much better than last year. "We invited them to acknowledge the effort they put in their studies. “I'd like them to obtain a 100% pass rate with high marks. “They are mostly from rural areas but we want them to be motivated to be the best like any school in the city. It is not an impossible dream.”
