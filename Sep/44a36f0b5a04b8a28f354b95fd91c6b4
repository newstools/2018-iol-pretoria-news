Boikhutsong informal settlement residents in Mabopane blocked roads this morning with trees, rocks and tyres demanding the DA led administration give them services. The community built their shacks on the edge of a mountain back in 2013 and believe the City has been sluggish in giving them services. They decided to protest in the streets because the City was threatening to disconnect their illegally connected electricity. They want the City to know that its officials will only be allowed to disconnected their power if the City was going to immediately replace the illegal connections with legal electricity. Policing authorities from the South Africa Police Services and the Tshwane Metro Police Department have been deployed in various areas in the community to contain the situation. The angry crowd chased away a vehicle that tried to remove all the rubble thrown on the streets adjacent to the Lucas Makinta main road.

Community leader George Mlojwa said: "The City is not taking us seriously and it has been giving us a lot of empty promises. We've submitted countless memorandums and we've visited many offices including that of City Manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola. "Right now we are saying enough is enough. "We want them to know that we have been living here for many years without services. "Some of the people here lived in the informal settlement in 1994. "However, all we have are water pipes without pressure," he said.
