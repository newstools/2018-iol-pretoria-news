Exhibitors also had the opportunity to showcase their equipment to Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and her team of SANDF delegates. Mapisa-Nqakula’s entourage met exhibitors and gave them time to showcase their creations and explain their defence purposes and value to today’s society. The minister watched and asked questions about how they would positively impact the South African economy in terms of manufacturing and job creation for the youth. Other technological innovations viewed included firearms manufactured locally and exhibited by South African engineers. Mapisa-Nqakula was familiar with some of the young faces of engineers who were employed in the local defence industry, she conversed with them. “What I am particularly pleased to see at this event are the skills and resources that we employ in this regard. Besides the men and women in uniform, trained to be vigilant in protecting and securing our airspace and maritime zones, the technologies involved are overwhelming. “We are all aware of the growing threat to cyber-security. It is paramount that efficient, powerful and cost-effective cyber-defence solutions be implemented to protect the critical information infrastructure,” said Mapisa-Nqakula. International delegates, leaders of defence forces and defence business people viewed items they desired and saw as good investments. Carts were used to transport delegates from one hangar to the next as exhibition areas were not in the same space. Some of the breathtaking innovations included defence vehicles, aircrafts, robots, amour, ammunition, bulletproof clothing and bulletproof cars. The three-day trade exhibition, which showcases world-class air and mobility track demonstrations, technological displays from some of the biggest names in the aviation and defence industry runs until tomorrow. On Saturday and Sunday, it will be open to the public.
