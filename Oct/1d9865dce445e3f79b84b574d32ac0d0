DURBAN – A South African reservation software company has launched a free online booking platform for restaurants in South Africa. Branded 'Requests by Dineplan', restaurants can now load an interactive booking widget onto their website, Facebook page and Google business listing for guests to make quick and easy booking requests online. It also merges into the Dineplan mobile app to allow consumers to make a booking on the go. Through the widget guests can choose the date, time and party size they would like to book for. After a request booking is made on the system the restaurant is automatically notified via SMS and email to respond to the guest timeously. Dineplan co-founder Greg Whitfield said that this platform is highly beneficial for restaurants, especially those still using outdated booking enquiry forms on their websites. Requests by Dineplan is free of charge to encourage restaurants to offer online reservations. "It has become standard practice to book flights, rental cars, accommodation and movies online, and restaurant bookings are no different," said Whitfield. "Our longer-term goal is that we can convert many of the restaurants using the free Requests by Dineplan platform onto one of the paid-for packages that Dineplan offers, however, there is no obligation for a restaurant to upgrade," concluded Whitfield.
