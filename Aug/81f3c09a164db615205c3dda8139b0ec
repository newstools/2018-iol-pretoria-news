The City has over the past few days recorded power failures in areas such as Soshanguve and Orchards owing to cable theft. The City indicated that Orchards extensions 46, 47, 84, 88, 90, 91 and 99 had been plunged into darkness following cable theft at the Rosslyn substation on Thursday. And in a separate incident, cables were stolen between Soshanguve and Rietgat substations, affecting Block P, R, Y, T, V, SS, KK and Buffer Zone in Soshanguve. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said their technicians immediately attended to both. Power supply was restored by the weekend. On July 25, residents of Soshanguve Block WW and part of UU were also left without power owing to vandalism and attempted main feeder cable theft. The latest setbacks occurred just days after executive mayor Solly Msimanga unveiled the fleet of 103 off-road vehicles - worth R30m - to be used by the Cable Theft Unit. It was announced that the vehicles would be on 24-hour patrol of substations across the city, which would also be manned by a new team of 1000 security guards Msimanga said at the time they had identified hotspot substations which impacted numerous areas when hit by criminals. These included Rooiwal, Wapadrand and Waltloo. The move to beef up security personnel to deal with cable theft comes as the City experienced an upsurge in incidents, which were, according to Msimanga, bleeding the City dry. From July to December last year, a total of 1160 incidents of cable theft were reported, costing the City close to R62m in repairs. Annually, the City has been losing R200m to cable theft. City manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola noted that the criminals were using rough terrain and mountainous areas to evade police. This prompted the City to purchase the off-road vehicles.
