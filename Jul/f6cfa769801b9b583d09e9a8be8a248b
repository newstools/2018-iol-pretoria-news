GAUTENG Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza has confirmed that allegations of R7 million in government funding having gone missing from the Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa Child and Youth Centre is being investigated by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation. Mayathula-Khoza announced the investigation following her oversight visit to the centre in Soshanguve this afternoon. The visit follows media reports and a deterred oversight by DA members of parliament, alleging that the children were wearing torn, dirty clothing and not being properly fed. Following a meeting with the centre’s executive management team, Mayathula-Khoza was taken on a tour of the facility to some of the key areas purported to be in neglect by reports. Her first stop was at the laundry section of the centre to check the condition of the clothes the children were given.

Laundry supervisor Violet Moloi, informed the MEC that all of the children’s clothing was clean and they never kept torn garments. She also inspected the fridges and the menu, as well as the dormitories of the boys and girls. Of the condition of the centre Mayathula-Khoza said she was half happy that issues such as infrastructure were being looked into, but was concerned about the security. Fences had gaps in between and there was no proper management of who had access to the centre. “I am happy that some of the things are being looked into now. But a lot still needs to be done to ensure the safety of these children,” she said.
