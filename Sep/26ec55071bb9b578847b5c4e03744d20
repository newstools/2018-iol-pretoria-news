The pupils had travelled from schools in Gauteng to take advantage of the continent’s biggest defence exhibition, the bi-annual extravaganza which ends on Sunday. They spent the day visiting hangers to learn about the use of defence equipment and the careers they would need to follow to be involved in the creation, marketing, repairing and distribution of equipment. They also viewed aircraft in the spacious base and learnt about their role in defence missions. The pupils learnt about the equipment, vehicles and aircraft, and the employment opportunities from the moment they were invented until they were distributed, sold and serviced. Generals and seniors staff from the SA National Defence Force, Navy, Military Police and SA Health Services encouraged the youngsters to study hard and apply for defence and aviation careers that interested them. MP Nomhle Dambuza, who sits on the defence portfolio committee, was there to talk to the pupils. She said the exhibition was important because it came with a Youth Development Programme that created awareness and opportunities for young people. Xolani Vilani and Sibongiseni Gadebe from Swartklip Combined School said they were happy to be invited to the exhibition and they were considering applying to join the air force as pilots after passing matric. Nomthandazo Mthetho of Emshukantambo Secondary School in Soweto said: “I am interested in joining the Navy. I love everything that those guys do and I love the ocean so I know I will enjoy it.”
