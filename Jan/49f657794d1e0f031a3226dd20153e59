Large sections of the roof were severely damaged by the extreme weather conditions, including the strong wind, that prevailed in the eastern parts of the capital. Some sections of the roof that were blown off also damaged other parts of the stadium structure. The stadium forms part of the facilities inherited after the merger process in 2011, in terms of which the former Metsweding District Municipality, which included the Kungwini Local Municipality within which Ekangala was situated, merged with the City of Tshwane. Initial evaluation indicated the dilapidated state of the stadium which required upgrading intervention. The department enlisted the stadium into a portfolio for facilities that underwent professional Conditional Assessment by the CSIR, appointed in 2012, to develop a turn-around facilities’ maintenance strategic plan for 10 years. According to the CSIR’s report, the condition of the building overall was at 70% (a fair condition), but the site works overall was assessed at 30% (in bad condition). It indicated that the main causes of the deterioration was the prolonged lack of maintenance, malicious damage to the property and normal wear and tear. “The preservation programme would, at the time, have cost R4.89million. It would have included planned and unplanned maintenance, rehabilitation, repairs and replacements. Unfortunately, this programme was not undertaken by the previous administration,” said Mokhotho. “The damage inflicted during the storm is extensive and likely to exceed the anticipated cost, as previously indicated. “I will request that the department conduct a thorough and professional assessment of the damage and the current state of the facility, which will inform the budget allocation process and the best way forward.”
