This is pending a revision application by the business organisation Sakeliga later before court, to interdict Eskom from implementing its decision to interrupt or discontinue power supplies to municipalities in similar situations. Sakeliga’s chief executive Piet le Roux said the pending revision application is of utter importance as it could eventually provide a national solution for communities that are prejudiced by defaulting municipalities. “Currently there are more than 30 towns listed on Eskom’s website that face power interruptions, similar to Musina. We cannot allow that paying electricity users’ power be cut simply because one arm of the state - a local municipality - does not pay its accounts to another arm of the state,” Le Roux said. He said “an economic catastrophe is unfolding in local communities”. Sakeliga’s revision application, expected to be heard next year, will be a test case and the outcome will be applied at national level in the interest of local communities and economies. Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, said recently in Parliament that municipal debt to Eskom this year had increased from R13.6billion to R17bn in six months. Judge Nomsa Khumalo took about a minute to issue the interdict against Eskom as there was no opposition. Zelda Venter
