Both teams proved to be more than capable of playing the game and supporters applauded them for the fast pace at which they played. Both teams had a common goal and that was to win and no time was wasted on the netball court; it was a quick catch, pass and score. Claiming victory was the South African Army team as they beat their rivals 57 points to 29. The games form part of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) Prestige Week, taking place at various venues across the city. The week is aimed at encouraging fitness and social cohesion among members through sports as fundamentals of a combat-ready force. SAMHS supporters were satisfied with their team’s performance. The group of women cheered on and celebrated whenever their team scored. Although they lost the game they were satisfied with their team’s performance, saying they gave their rivals a tough time. One of the supporters said each goal scored by their team’s rivals was hard earned as they didn’t give them goals easily. Simultaneously, other members played other sports such as tennis, soccer, rugby and volleyball, among others. One of the supporters spotted cheering for her SAMHS tennis team the loudest was Sergeant Neo Malope. She told the Pretoria News tennis was the best sport as it was all about honesty and discipline. “This is a gentlemen’s sport because the players are the ones keeping their own scores but if there’s a technicality they can request an umpire.” Malope is a tennis player herself and is a gold holder in the SANDF Gauteng ladies category and ranked number three in the national team. Finals in all the sports codes will be held today.
