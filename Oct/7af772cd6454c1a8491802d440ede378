The ruling was made by Speaker Katlego Mathebe during a council sitting last month, following the tabling of a vote of no confidence against Msimanga by the ANC. Msimanga said the stance by the party was a way of derailing council from executing its primary mandate. He spoke to journalists yesterday outside the Pretoria Central police station, where he went to dispose of an answering affidavit to allegations levelled against him by Maepa. Two weeks ago Maepa lodged an urgent application in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, seeking to have Mathebe’s ruling rendered null and void. Msimanga said the City’s lawyers were confident that Maepa’s case would not succeed in court. The application was an attempt to derail council from what needed to be done, he said. In court papers, Msimanga expressed his doubts on whether Maepa was mandated by the ANC to go to court. “There is no document that suggests that he has the mandate of the ANC to do what he is doing.” According to Msimanga, Maepa was trying to confuse issues pertaining to the ongoing GladAfrica tender investigation and allegations of mismanagement by city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola. GladAfrica was at the centre of the allegations levelled against Mosola that he illegally awarded a tender to the company to assist in the rolling out of the infrastructure projects valued at R12 billion. Msimanga said: “You can’t therefore bring those (before court) on an urgent basis. We are seeing this for what it is. This is a political manoeuvring. The desperation of the ANC under Maepa is beginning to show in the City of Tshwane.” The matter will be heard at the Gauteng High Court on October 23.
