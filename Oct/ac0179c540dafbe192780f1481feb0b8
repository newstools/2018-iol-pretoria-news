The parties officially sealed their partnership with more than 50 royal houses from across the country and various religious groups on Saturday. They signed an agreement in Pretoria during a royal partnering agreement ceremony, initiating an agreement intended to reunite royal houses of monarchs. One of their many intention is to unseat the ANC in next’s year’s general elections. The party, led by Amahlubi Monarch, King Brayce Mthimkhulu III, was launched earlier this year. They described the party as a “collective authority of the people of South Africa by their traditional leadership”. Mthimkhulu said the agreement paves the way for a collective to handle challenges such as homelessness and marginalisation of the poor. At the event, held at the Irene Country Club, Mthimkhulu lambasted existing political parties for being gluttonous. “We all know how greedy our politicians are. They want it all for themselves. They have forgotten about the people, all these (political) parties,” he told the traditional chiefs. He said there was widely felt dissatisfaction among traditional leaders about their powers being taken away from them. It was for this reason that traditional leaders entered into a partnering agreement.
