DURBAN – Facebook users are being misled into thinking that their Facebook accounts has been cloned because of a viral message according to Time. The message that has been doing the rounds since Sunday says that the sender has received a duplicate friend request from the recipient. Then the receiver is then told to forward the same message to their friends. This has led many people forwarding the same message to all of their friends and others thinking that there may be an issue with their account. The message also suggests that the receiver may have been the victim of a cloning scam. Then the malicious user makes copies of the images and information from the user's Facebook account to create a clone account. Then through the duplicated account friend requests are sent to the victim's friends. The user of the cloned account then sends friend requests in an attempt to learn personal information. According to Facebook, they have heard that some people are seeing posts or messages about accounts being cloned on Facebook and that it takes the form of a chain mail type of notice. People have told Facebook that they don't like seeing the same post that a lot of people are copying and pasting on Facebook. If enough people post the same long post it could show up lower in the News Feeds of people. Claiming to be another person goes against the Community Standards of Facebook and Facebook has a dedicated team that has been tasked with detecting blocking these kinds of scams. Facebook is also encouraging people to let them know about accounts being impersonated through reporting tools. Follow the Business Report on Instagram here BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
