Municipal spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said the City was dismayed after discovering a notice circulating via a short messaging platform about a bogus vacancy for an office administration assistant advertised on Gumtree. “Once the applicants submit their applications on Gumtree, they will receive a message inviting targeted individuals to an assessment test purportedly to be held at Tshwane House municipal headquarters,” he said. He said the unsuspecting victims were requested to deposit R1500 into a money market outlet or Absa bank. The money would allegedly be used to prepare a pass-out letter which will enable the applicant to secure a job without going through an interview. “The public is cautioned not to fall for the scam as there is no such post. In addition, we urge the public to be always vigilant of fraudulent activities and not to pay anyone for a job application,” Mashigo said. “The public can contact the Tshwane Metro Police Department on 0828918625 whenever they come across such dodgy job adverts.
