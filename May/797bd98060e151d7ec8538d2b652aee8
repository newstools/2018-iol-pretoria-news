In a statement read out by his defence yesterday, Saunders said he killed the toddler after giving her ant poison to drink because of issues between himself and Courtney’s mother. Saunders had been renting a room at Courtney’s parents’ house. In his statement, Saunders said: “I rented a room in the home and on May 4, 2017, her parents left her in the care of the brother.” He said he was also at home that day. During the course of the morning, he went to the bathroom and 10 to 15 minutes later Courtney came to his room. He told her to leave which she did, but she returned later and “being irritated” because of issues between the mother and himself he gave Courtney ant poison. “She started coughing and after neighbours started calling out to her she tried to scream.” Saunders admitted he knew he could not let her be found in the state she was in as it was clear the ant poison would not just just make her sick, but  kill her. He panicked and choked her, and then wrapped a towel around her face. “I remained in my room for about an hour after that,” he said. Saunders further said that fter killing her he used his fingers to penetrate her as he got aroused. However, he denied penetrating her with his penis. On the rape charge Saunders pleaded not guilty, while on the murder charge he pleaded guilty, but argued it was not premeditated. However, the State rejected his pleas, saying it believed the murder was premeditated. He said that when her parents returned that evening he knew they would look for her and decided to dump her body. Courtney’s body was found days later buried in a shallow grave in nearby Epping Industria. - African News Agency (ANA)
