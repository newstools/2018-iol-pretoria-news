The Mr Fix-It of Home Affairs Department is awaiting his fate after President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would decide the way forward in due course. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane recommended that Ramaphosa act against Gigaba within 14 days for his role in the Fireblade Aviation issue.On Wednesday, Mkhwebane agreed with the courts that Gigaba lied under oath about approving the Oppenheimer’s facility at the OR Tambo International Airport. Gigaba’s application for leave to appeal against the judgment was also dismissed by the Constitutional Court. The bombshell came as Gigaba was trying to put out the fires of a leaked video of him engaging in a sexual act. Gigaba is alone in the 13-second video in which he is seen playing with his penis with his hand while saying: “Imagine if this is in your mouth.” He claimed it was intercepted from his cellphone and had been meant for his wife. Social media was unforgiving and did not buy his explanation, with some alleging the explicit material had been intended for his girlfriend. The minister insisted it was a political attempt to assassinate his character as the ANC compiles its list of MPs ahead of next year’s elections. But whether he will still be minister or not by then remains to be seen.
