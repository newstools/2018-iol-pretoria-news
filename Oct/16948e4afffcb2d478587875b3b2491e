Struggle veteran Tlou Theophilus Cholo was this afternoon conferred an honorary doctorate by the Tshwane University of Technology for his extraordinary contributions to society. He was honoured during a spring graduation ceremony where scores of faculty of humanities students had gathered to receive their qualifications. TUT chancellor Dr Gwen Ramokgopa who is also the Gauteng MEC for Health conferred the honour at a packed Gencor Community Hall at the Soshanguve South campus. During the ceremony, the institution described him as a selfless cadre who sacrificed his lifetime in the struggle against apartheid. He was an exceptional leader in the trade union movement from Ga-Matlala, Limpopo. He was one of the founders of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (Sactu) in the 1950s, and a recipient of the SA Governmentâ€™s Order of Luthuli in Silver (2009) for his selfless devotion and sacrifice to the fight against apartheid. He was also among the first volunteer cadres of Umkhonto we Sizwe to leave the country for military training. The struggle veteran said he was overwhelmed to have been honoured while he was still alive. He encouraged students who had gathered to receive their qualifications to never stop studying.
