Pretoria Technical High School female pupils stood together today just as the 1956 women who marched to the Union Buildings to petition against the country’s pass law. The group of girls together with their female teachers and members of the school governing body raised their placards high and sang their lungs out. They made their way to a park near the Pretoria Art Museum in Arcadia where there is a giant megaphone. The megaphone was erected at the park in February. Although following the footsteps of the country’s heroines, the group did not have any petition at hand but rather shared encouraging words through poems. Designer of the megaphone and Afrikaans teacher, Lira van Staden said this was an interactive sculpture which was a symbol to give the public a voice.

The symbol around them is crossing the diversity gap between people living in the suburbs and those in the city,” she said. One of the pupils, Yedidyah Alimasi said the march inspired her to be a strong woman with a voice to stand up for the voiceless. She said: “The women who marched to the Union Buildings stood together and ensured that we have a place in this country today. And if we follow in their footsteps and start now as young girls, we can achieve great things as we grow older.” Alimasi said young people today had a voice to change a nation but did not know it because they were not given opportunities. “If women are given opportunities, they can do the unthinkable. "For example, I was a very shy person but our teacher created a public speaking club which I  joined. It was then that I discovered that I have a voice and something to offer,” she said.
