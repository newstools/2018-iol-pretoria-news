The group was selected after coming up with the best anti-littering drawing last week. Their prize was announced during an award ceremony hosted by the city of Tshwane at the Walter Sisulu Environmental Centre in Mamelodi at the weekend. The team of four pupils from different schools across the city entered a competition on keeping Pretoria clean. The competition was organised by the city’s agriculture and environmental management department, with the aim of encouraging pupils to participate in the environmental awareness campaign. “We entered the competition on behalf of our school by drawing a picture of people discarding papers in a dustbin to illustrate the importance of taking care of one’s environment,” said Pontsho. The prize-giving was graced by Miss Earth SA 2018 finalist Sarah Chemaly, who encouraged pupils to mobilise communities to clean up their environment. “We also educate them on the types of materials that can be recycled,” said Chemaly. The MMC for agriculture and environmental management, Mike Mkhari, said the event coincided with the city’s recycling week commemoration. “We are trying to encourage communities to be active in clean-up campaigns. We also encourage them to plant trees and get involved in recycling.” He motivated people to recycle materials in order to assist the city in saving landfill sites. “Again, through recycling, people can turn trash into cash and make a living out of it,” he said. Tshwane’s environment and parks head, Aluoneswi Mafunz- waini, said the competition gave children an opportunity to spread the anti-dumping message through creative drawings. “We need them to be ambassadors of the anti-littering campaign at an early age. The idea is to spread the message at the local level,” he said.
