On June 20, residents of Nkandla informal settlement hijacked construction vehicles and forced drivers to surrender their concrete loads, which they used to build illegal speed bumps. The incident followed yet another accident in which a resident was hit by a taxi, which then sped away. The crowd used the concrete to build numerous speed bumps on the road and then urged MEC for Roads and Transport, Dr Ismail Vadi, to replace these with legal structures.

However, motorists complained that the illegal speed bumps were too high and would damage cars. Subsequently, ward councillor Enos Chiloane convened a community meeting to announce that the speed humps would be replaced. Community leader Solly Masanabo said yesterday: “We are finally happy to see the construction workers replacing the speed bumps. From the beginning, we wanted the department to do that. Lots of people have to cross the M20 every day. As long as there are speed bumps, we will be happy.” Masanabo said the community knew hijacking construction vehicles to use their concrete to build the bumps on a main road was wrong, but it was a decision they were forced to make. He said for a long time they complained about the road but could not get a proper answer on whether the provincial government or City owned it.
