The project, launched by the institution in partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, committed to embark on a five-year research programme. It aims to optimise the control of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids in people with diabetes. Professor Paul Rheeder said the initiation and up-titration of insulin in primary care in the country has been identified as a major challenge in diabetes care and achieving optimal insulin control. He said this was due to the lack of healthcare practitioners trained in insulin use, scarcity of resources and psychological insulin resistance by patients. “A 261% increase was projected for diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa between the year 2000 and 2013. We, together with the Congo, are the African leaders in diabetes. “It is mentioned that diabetes deaths are second only to tuberculosis in this country. “It is frightening that more people in Africa die from diabetes than malaria, HIV and TB put together, so diabetes is definitely the new tsunami, the new epidemic of this century,” he said. “We know how to prevent non-communicable diseases, but we need to figure out how to get people to eat healthily, be involved in physical activity and stop smoking and drinking,” said the deputy director-general of the national Department of Health, Dr Yogan Pillay. He said diabetes was strongly associated with obesity, which was a huge problem faced by the country. He told delegates that they needed to figure out how to deal with obesity in order to deal with diabetes. “You can’t deal with diabetes without dealing with obesity. “We tell patients to eat a balanced meal, but it’s not easy when you come from low socio-economic circumstances to eat a balanced meal.” Pillay further mentioned that according to the 2016 data by Statistics SA, an estimated 1.8million adults are living with diabetes in the country.
