Bonisiwe Sibisi , a Grade 10 pupil from Ekangala Comprehensive high school was one of the many who attended the 2018 Sasol Solar Challenge exhibition at the Sun Arena at Menlyn Casino. Nine of the futuristic vehicles are on full display for the public to admire for free. This also gave the different teams time to tie up loose ends and interact with the public. The powerful end-to-end challenge will begin tomorrow at the Sun Arena and end in Stellenbosch next week on Sunday. The solar cars will embark on a challenging 2500km route through mountains, desert, cities and small towns. Sibisi said she appreciated the rare opportunity to witness such carefully crafted cars. And although she will not be persuing the science and engineering route she said the work on the solar cars was inspiring. “Our school doesn’t often have trips like this where we meet smart people who want to change the world. This is an awesome experience,” she said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Many others pupils from different schools shared Sibisi’s sentiments. They circled the solar cars in amazement. Inquisitive pupils asked questions about the carefully crafted solar cars, while others just marveled at them. Most of the teams are from universities, giving students the chance to apply their engineering education. Over the years, the Sasol Solar Challenge has inspired students to develop new technology and they have contributed to core research on solar technology, including the manufacturing of solar cells, their casing, converters, controllers and electronics. The research done by the solar car teams has become invaluable to the energy industry.
