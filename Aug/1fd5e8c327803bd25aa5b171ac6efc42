They vowed yesterday to remain there until President Cyril Ramaphosa had spoken to them. The group arrived on Tuesday and was joined by EFF Student Command members from Durban and Pretoria to request Ramaphosa to grant all arrested #FeesMustFall student activists amnesty. Yesterday, they said they had been visited by various civil organisations that believed that Ramaphosa had the power to pardon the students. Khanyile was found guilty of public violence, failing to comply with a police instruction and for possession of a dangerous weapon last Monday. He is due for sentencing on October 16. But until then, he is determined to sleep outside the Union Buildings. The students said they were determined to stay put although they were aware Ramaphosa was in Parliament. Khanyile said: “We are not going to leave until he comes and speaks to us face-to-face because he is the one who has the power to pardon us. “One director from his legal department came here with two senior executives, but we told them we want the president and no one else. “They tried to make us submit a memorandum, but when have you ever heard of people taking action because someone left a memorandum? They probably have a pile of memorandums in the Union Buildings. “We are students who fought for free tertiary education, which is being implemented. We therefore should be pardoned because we are accused of less important crimes without even any concrete evidence.” The list of students who could benefit from a presidential pardon include Khaya Cekeshe, a student at a media academy in Braamfontein. He was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, three years suspended. EFF Student Command leader Amos “Amla” Monageng was expelled from the University of Pretoria and sentenced to a year of house arrest. Other students activists who were expelled from the university included Surprise Silowe, Wandile Masango, Thulani Masilela and Herman Mashaba.
