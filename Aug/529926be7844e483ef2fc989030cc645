Marchers from organisations across Tshwane and Johannesburg escorted by metro police, are taking part in this morning’s #TotalShutDown march. The march, organised by the Intersectional Women’s March Against Gender Based Violence (GBV) is a call by women on civil society and the government to put a stop to such violence. Scores of women have committed to kicking off this Women’s Month in style by marching, dressed in black, with a splash of red, to mourn children and women who have died as a result of GBV.
