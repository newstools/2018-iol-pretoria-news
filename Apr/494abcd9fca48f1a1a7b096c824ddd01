They emulated Akani Simbine and Henricho Bruintjies, who raced to South Africa’s first sprinting double at the Games only three days before. The day belonged to Ntutu setting a new Games record of 10.80 seconds during the morning heats before landing the 100m title. Ntutu was in a class of his own blitzing over the line in first place with a time of 11.02 for his gold medal. Three-time Paralympic champion Langenhoven followed in second place clocking 11.27 to secure the double. “I tried to run as fast as I can but winning the gold medal, aagh, nothing can describe the feeling that I am feeling at the moment,” Ntutu said. “I’m sure it will hit me even harder when I get home.” It was Langenhoven’s second silver medal following his second-place in the 400m in Melbourne 2006. Ntutu won the silver at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. - Ockert de Villiers
