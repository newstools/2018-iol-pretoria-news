“I admired the way he was prepared to put in the hard work for whichever team he was playing. That is something I’m also striving to do,” says Smit, who is known for his big heart and determination. Smit might not be the biggest player in the Tuks team in next year’s Varsity Cup tournament, but as his teammates and opponents know he punches above his weight. Tuks Sevens rugby coach Andries Kruger says Smit not only relishes going for the hard tackles, but has perfected the art of doing so. “What makes him so useful is that he has a real sense for the game. It’s as if he can anticipate what’s going to happen next.” At the moment the 19-year-old Smit is 1.86m tall, but weighs only 86kg, which is considered small for a flank forward. He admits that it is quite a challenge to gain weight. However, Kruger is confident that once he does, his impact on the game will be even more effective. The coach says Smit is also the ultimate team player. He played four Sevens tournaments for Tuks before scoring his first try. Kruger says it shows Smit puts the team ahead of himself. When listening to Smit talk rugby, it becomes clear that he is hell-bent on making the most of any opportunity that comes his way. When he got the opportunity to play for the Tuks second side against the A team, he impressed to such an extent that he became a regular in the Carlton Cup competition and went on to play Varsity Rugby.
