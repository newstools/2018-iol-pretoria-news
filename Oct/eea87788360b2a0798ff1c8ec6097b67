Speaker Katlego Mathebe made the ruling during last month’s council sitting, after the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence against the mayor. The party wanted the voting for the motion to be executed through a secret ballot, but Mathebe decided to have it done by a show of hands. In court papers, the ANC said the use of a secret ballot would have been appropriate to decide on the motion given allegations that DA councillors were scared to act against incumbent Msimanga. ANC caucus leader Dr Kgosi Maepa cited a sworn affidavit by City manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola to demonstrate an element of fear within the DA. In the affidavit, Mosola related how he had to defend himself and physically fight back against councillor Cilliers Brink. The altercation contributed to a situation of mistrust and fear in council, he claimed. He believed Mathebe undermined the Constitutional Court judgment by overlooking the potential danger faced by DA councillors who would like to unseat Msimanga. In a case between National Assembly Speaker and the United Democratic Party, the Constitutional Court said one of the bases for allowing voting via secret ballot must be necessitated by an element of corruption. Maepa previously argued that element had been demonstrated by allegations of corruption related to a multi-million rand tender awarded to engineering company GladAfrica. He expressed confidence yesterday that his party’s lawyers would put up strong arguments. Also, that the case would decided in the ANC’s favour. “The ANC is going to win the case straight forward,” he said. Tiyiseleni Babane, the strategic executive head in the office of the speaker, said the City’s lawyers were ready to defend the stance taken during council sitting. The respondents in the case include Msimanga, the City of Tshwane, DA, EFF, Cope, the ACDP, the PAC and Freedom Front Plus.
