Pretoria - Mamelodi commuters using the A Re Yeng bus service were this morning forced to use alternative transport as services were halted due to threats to burn buses, by angry residents over issues of overloading. A Re Yeng issued a statement on Facebook on Sunday night advising commuters to make alternative travel arrangements. It is unclear when the buses will be operational again. “Please be advised that on Monday, November 12 2018 A Re Yeng bus services in Mamelodi will not be operational. "This is due to serious threats made on social media and on the ground to burn buses due to overloading. “ You are advised to make alternative travel arrangements during this time,” the statement reads. Commuters responded with anger. Olga Bobo Sbosh Malobola said: “This is annoying, you say make alternative travel arrangements as if we didn’t buy a month worth of travel points, this won’t be resolved in a day.” Tshuma Sithabiso: “There are too many buses in town just send some to relieve pressure in Mams, those buses don't even have passengers like those in location. What's painful is that you are still selling tickets while you know buses are less.” Zandi Nkosi told the Pretoria News that she had to use the Gautrain as a result. “Some people didn’t see the statement on Facebook nor did they receive text messages notifying them about this so they woke up and went to the stops to wait for buses,” she said. The Tshwane Rapid Transit is expected to hold a media briefing in Hatfield this afternoon in respect of the suspended operation. Pretoria News
