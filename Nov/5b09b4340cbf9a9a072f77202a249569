The 16-year-old said the protesters would be fully dressed but silent, and added that her message was blown out of proportion. “I won’t be naked at the protest and I never said I would be. What comrade Boitumelo Thage and I initially wanted was to wear short skirts and dresses, which society believes gets women raped. “But after the media reports, we decided that people must wear their normal clothes and write whatever message they feel strongly about,” Zulaikha said. The Grade 10 pupil addedd that the planned protest was to stand in solidarity with global campaigns such as #ThisIsNotConsent, #HearMeToo and #NotInMyName. “We wanted to stress to society that under no circumstances can rape be the victim’s fault. “The 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children should rather be extended to 365 days because rape occurs every day," Zulaikha said. The silent protest was scheduled for outside the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court today from 8am until 12pm.
