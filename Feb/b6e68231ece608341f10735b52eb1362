From the opening scene the retelling of this classic story of the 1930s rural south in America had the audience under their spell. It is unusual in a musical in this country to see such a level of engagement, but women became visibly angry with the menacing Mister played by Aubrey Poo and they cheered on Celie, portrayed with such finesse by Didintle Khunou. As the story unfolded they could be seen punching the air, or wiping away a tear after a particularly moving song, such as Somebody Gonna Love You or I’m Here. And when it was over with an Amen, the audience stood and clapped and clapped. Oprah Winfrey - who starred in a film version, and was part of the team to present the stage show on Broadway, said everyone on stage and in the audience of The Color Purple bore witness to something “extraordinarily transcendent and uplifting”. The Color Purple, based on a book and a film, tells the story of Celie, the hardship she faces, those who push her down and those like Shug Avery played by Lerato Mvelase, who help her up, and how she grows in stature and is eventually reunited with her beloved sister. In an earlier interview, Khunou said telling stories that display “empowering and powerful representations of women” is important. The audience clearly agreed.
