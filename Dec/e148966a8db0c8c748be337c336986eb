The group of 20 women and men braved sweltering heat, getting by on just potatoes and water. They did this to hand over a list to President Cyril Ramaphosa in which they demanded the finalisation of the compensation to widows of the Marikana massacre. They also want the mines to be audited and for the communities around them to share in the profits made. The group arrived at the Union Buildings yesterday afternoon following a sleepover at the Atteridgeville Police Station on Tuesday. Group spokesperson Napoleon Webster said they walked from their community to ask Ramaphosa, in order to demonstrate the integrity and remorse he claimed to have by ensuring shareholdings be given to the widows of slain mineworkers. Webster said it was only befitting that the president ceded his 8% shares to the widows. He said what spurred them on the gruelling 80km walk was the fact that Ramaphosa had yet to visit the community. “We want his apology. He needs to see that we are willing to go through pain, endure anything, and sacrifice to get our pleas heard.” Webster said any investors looking to bring money into the country had to come with the intention of contributing to the economy and not “looting it of its mineral resources”. He said the group would return to the Union Buildings after 21 days to ensure their demands were taken seriously. “We want to know his position. If he wants to order action against us, we will bring our bodies so he can bring his killer police who killed our brothers.” The memorandum was accepted by Shonisani Mudau and Vincent Ngcobo from the Presidency.
