The social media user attached yet another video of the absurd fainting challenge which has taken South Africa by storm. Others responded with more pictures of people doing the #IdibalaChallenge. And mess is the best way to describe what has been witnessed online. As another Facebook user remarked, morals went out of the window the day the world was given the internet. To join, you simply get someone to take a video while you faint and post in online. The challenge gets its name from the lyrics of the latest hit song, Malwedhe, by the Bolobedu house music master. Simply search for #IdibalaChallenge and you will be shocked by some of the videos of fainting people that have been posted; others driving, cooking, dancing you name it. However, HoÃ«rskool Akasia pupils took matters too far when they took up the challenge in a classroom, while a teacher was going about her business. A few questions come up regarding the video. Chief among these is what happened to the good old days when schools were a respected place. What were cellphones doing in a classroom anyway? MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who condemned the incident, is often on record emphasising the need for discipline in schools. This should start with removing cellphones and emphasising that schools are for learning and teaching - and nothing else. Hope you all have a good weekend. If you are gong to to Idibala, do so safely and responsibly.
