The elephant, named Hot Stuff, was shot on September 1 after he broke out of the reserve. According to management, the 29-year-old bull broke out on Wednesday, August 29, at 3am and was spotted walking close to the N1. By that Friday evening he was treading a route across neighbouring farmland. Members of Elephants, Rhinos and People have criticised management for not informing them of their decision to put Hot Stuff down. The organisation said this was despite it being a strategic partner for elephant management in the reserve. It has invested over R2million in the reserve to protect elephants and rhinos through a strategy that is based on rural poverty alleviation. The director of operations at the organisation, Dereck Milburn, said they were accusing Dinokeng of going against their contract, which stated that any decision regarding the elephants needed to be disclosed. It gave management 14 days to respond to questions relating to Hot Stuff’s death. No response was received. Milburn, who lives at Dinokeng, said they were instead told they were not allowed on the premises anymore. He said their agreement also stated that elephants were only meant to be darted and not shot. “I asked about the state of the elephants on the Friday, a day before he (Hot Stuff) was shot. I was told nothing.” He said the inexplicable secrecy has fuelled unconfirmed reports that Hot Stuff's meat was sold in Bela Bela. Milburn said they were taking the legal route to deal with the matter. “Clearly, we can’t get the whole truth. We are relying now on the courts for the truth to surface,” he said yesterday. According to Dinokeng Management Association, Hot Stuff was destroyed under a Damage Causing Permit clause. “Unfortunately, he had become a risk to the reserve, neighbouring communities, farmers and the very busy N1 motorway on the west of the reserve. During August, several breakouts took place with him heading towards the N1 highway." See Page 11
