However, in recent days, Makhura has given a clear indication that he and the Tshwane first citizen do not see eye to eye. The premier previously blasted Msimanga for failing to assist the families of the Soshanguve high-mast light tragedy. However, he turned up the heat in the past week when he publicly said Msimanga was inefficient. He referred to the Hammanskraal water woes, which many have pointed out in the past started when the ANC was in power in the metro. While in Ekurhuleni, Makhura urged the DA to channel its attention towards “the worst performing metro” which was Tshwane. And on Friday, he blasted Msimanga in front of more than 5000 people who had joined the march against e-tolls to the Union Buildings. It could be that Makhura is playing politics against his rival for the position of premier in the 2019 general election; whatever the case may be, you would expect people in their positions to settle their differences behind closed doors. Police in Soshanguve are again in trouble, this time following the death of an informal trader, allegedly at their hands. You will remember that two police officers from the same area were arrested after the death of a TUT student during a riot. It cannot be business as usual when a life has been lost under questionable circumstances. The community and family of the deceased deserve to know the truth of what really happened on Friday. Wishing all our readers and advertisers a productive week.
