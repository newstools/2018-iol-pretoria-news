Staff from the Department of Health this morning continued protesting outside the "dilapidated and unhealthy" headquarters in Thabo Sehume Street in Pretoria. They were led by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union and the Public Servants Association as they refused to enter the building to resume work following yesterday's protest. The staff have been downing tools since the beginning of the year complaining that the building was unsafe to work inside. They said air conditioning, fire extinguishers, ceilings, lifts and carpets were not up to standard. They staged the first total shutdown yesterday morning when they blocked the main entrance on Thabo Sehume Street and two side entrances. The department's management had to call the police to help re-open two side entrances to allow staff who wanted to work to enter the building. The two unions' leadership arrived at the department this morning to address the protesters and give them a progress report from a meeting with the ministers of health and public works last night. The unions claim that the department was taking an attendance register of the staff that continued working during the protests. They plan to challenge the decision as it could threaten workers to not exercise their rights to protest. The staff said Minister of Health Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi could not continue making them work in a building that does not have windows and fully functional air conditioners. They said they were breathing carbon dioxide and that was a threat to their health. They said one day a person will die in the building.
