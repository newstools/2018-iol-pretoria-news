A large crowd, including small children, flocked to the area from as early as 7am, causing traffic congestion at the areas surrounding the base. The display that stood out was that of a Gripen. People cheered and pulled out cellphones to take videos and pictures, seemly fascinated by the sound it made. Other aircraft displayed included the Hawk, Lockheed C130, Oryx, Agusta 109, Pilatus 12, Rooivalk, Vampire, Cessna 185, Explora and many more. The airshow was designed to attract aviation enthusiasts, the public as well as serving and former members of the SAAF, providing an opportunity to celebrate military aviation in both static and flying conditions. The theme for this year was “Our Indomitable Spirit” and intended to appreciate and recognise the collective and individual sacrifices of the members in pursuit and realisation of the SAAF’s mandate. After the show those who attended were treated to a performance by members of the SAAF brass band.
