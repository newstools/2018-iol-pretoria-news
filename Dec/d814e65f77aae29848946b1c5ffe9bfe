Areas which are likely to be affected are Mabopane, Morula View and Winterveldt. Water interruptions will be from 4am next Wednesday, December 12, until midnight on Thursday, December 13. Metro spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said the shutdown was necessary for the City to connect the newly installed 1200mm steel pipe to an existing one at the Mabopane main reservoir outlet. It was also necessary for the scheduled work to take place, and required the City to shut down the water supply in the area. Mashigo said the work was necessary as it would lessen the need for unplanned maintenance, limit possible pipe bursts and improve water supply overall in the community. During the shutdown, roaming water tankers in the affected areas will supply residents with water.
