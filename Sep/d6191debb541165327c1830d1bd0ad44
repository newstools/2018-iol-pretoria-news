Dr Johan Burger, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, talks to Pretoria News about the recently released crime stats . He expressed his concern with some crimes like murder and also commended efforts on crimes like aggravated violence going down from previous years. There was a 6.9% increase in murder over the 2017/2018 period. This translates to 57 people being murdered every day. An estimated 20 336 people were killed during the period, 1 320 more than the previous year, and 40 035 were raped.

Police killings also contribute to the murder statistics - the highest number of officials killed at once was in the Ngcobo police station massacre earlier this year. Presenting the statistics, police minister Bheki Cele admitted that he himself was shocked by them. He said they are “nothing to write home about,” adding that rather than dwelling on the stats themselves the “emphasis is on what’s to be done.” Assault and common robbery have lessened over the period. Gauteng is the province in which the most crimes were reported over the period.
