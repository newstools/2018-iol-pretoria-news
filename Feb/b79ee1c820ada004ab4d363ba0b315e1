CHILDREN from various day care centres around Soshanguve are in high spirits as MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, together with officials from various law enforcement agencies engage with them on safety issues, as part of the early childhood development safety campaign.

The venue is also buzzing with songs and poems the children learn at their day care centres. Nkosi-Malobane who addressed the media ahead of the event said the purpose was to make children view police officers as their protectors and not monsters. “We want kids to be aware of the police and know that they are there to protect and care for them.

"We also want people to understand that police should not be used to scare children for example if a child does not want to eat or take a bath you say “I will call the police”,” she said. “We don't want police to be monsters to our children but to be seen as people who care for them". The MEC highlighted the significance of teaching them about road safety. “The children will also be taken to the ground where they will be taught about road safety, remember the festive season report is not looking good in terms of road fatalities. A couple of kids under five died, so it is important to educate them," he said. The session will culminate with the MEC handing over mattresses, blankets and stationery packs to needy day care centres.
