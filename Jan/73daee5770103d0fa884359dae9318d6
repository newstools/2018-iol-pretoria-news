EVERYTIME you see a Tshwane Metro Police Department vehicle remember they are not just trying to punish you by giving you fines but rather trying to keep you and others safe on our roads. The first thing motorists travelling down Zambezi drive reached for when pulling up to the TMPD’s roadblock were their licenses, but they were stopped for a different kind of roadblock. This time motorists were simply reminded to obey the rules of the road and treated to some world record attempts by members of the Sports Against Crime initiative. Nonhlanhla Mgiba, TMPD spokesperson, said this time they opted to use sport as part of their on-going road safety campaign. Mgiba said members regularly participated in campaigns being conducted in malls,churches and in particular during busy periods such as Easter, long weekends and festive season. She said: “We were simply stopping vehicles to hand out road safety tips to motorists. Just reminding them not to drink and drive, to avoid texting and to be safe when approaching traffic lights.” “We believe the message is getting out there as many people adhere to the rules of the road as it is. We used sport this time just to draw people in so they can get the information,” she added. Sports Against Crime member, Chris Batts, who participated in two world record attempts in Zambezi drive, said they always tried to get involved in initiatives that made a difference but also those that attracted people.  goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za
