The annual world run is scheduled to take place on Sunday at SuperSport Park in centurion at 1pm. Race pack collection takes place on saturday at Sportsmans Warehouse in Centurion, from 8:30am until 5pm. The global charity event sees thousands of people from all walks of life take part to make a difference in other people’s lives every year. The event has seen people of all ages - young, old and the wheelchair-bound take part in the event all in the name of aiding those with spinal cord problems. The race is not an ordinary one; there are different rules and unlike the usual run and fun walks that the public often take part in and aim for the finishing line, the Wings for Life World Run has no finishing line. Instead, the finishing line is determined by participants themselves. Thirty minutes into the race, a moving finishing line which is a “catcher car” chases runners along the course, gradually getting faster until each participant is caught. Participants aim to finish last instead of first as the last man and woman to be caught will be declared the Global Champions. This event takes place in 24 locations across 23 countries simultaneously, and athletes, casual joggers and beginners in their respective countries and continents start the race at the same time using the co-ordinated universal time. It is always held on the first weekend of May, to collect funds for the Wings for Life non-profit organisation. All entry fees and donations raised through fund-raising campaigns go directly to life-changing spinal cord research projects and clinical trials at prominent universities and institutes worldwide.
