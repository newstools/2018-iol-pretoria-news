The production team based in Erasmuskloof said they were fed up after being sent from pillar to post without any progress. Last Friday, employees were scheduled to appear before the CCMA, but Transport Department officials failed to show up, sending a letter stating the matter “did not belong before the CCMA”. One of the employees said: “This is what they always do when we take the matter forward. We have been to the Department of Labour, the CCMA and everywhere we could think of, but no one was willing to assist us.” The department previously said acting-deputy director general Chris Hlabisa would meet all stakeholders to resolve the impasse. But more than three weeks on, this was yet to happen. “We remain locked outside the work premises, and production remains at a standstill. There is no one to operate the machines. It will remain that way until they do what is right by us.” The workers manufacture, capture and issue licences. After the strike started, the department said motorists would receive licences despite the impasse. It had yet to comment by late yesterday..
