Its predecessor had been washed away by flash floods in 2014. The new bridge has been upgraded and reconstructed to the tune of R34million. The project included the reconstruction of a two-way carriageway and raising the road by 2m. After the bridge was washed away, a temporary bridge was constructed, which residents said was too low. It has now been replaced by an expanded bridge across the river, an upgraded single carriageway surfaced road and a stormwater drainage system upgrade. As a result of significant damages to the infrastructure, motorists and public transport operators had to detour when travelling to neighbouring communities. Vadi inspected the restored bridge, accompanied by the contractors who worked on it for over a year. He was pleased the new bridge was completed in time for Mandela Day. Resident Selina Ketso, who joined the MEC for the inspection, said: “I am happy a plan was made to fix the bridge.” Situated on Moiletswana and Lebanon roads, the bridge is an important link between communities. Tidimala Makhudu, another resident, said: “I live in Serope and we had to take a detour to go to Klipgat cemetery; it took us a while to get there, now it'll take a few minutes.” Vadi said: “This is a special occasion, not only are we unveiling a bridge, but on the centenary of Nelson Mandela. “From what I saw here two or three years ago, it's a wonderful improvement. Thank you to the workers. I was told there were no stoppages."
