Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool - Affies - and Pretoria Boys High School (Boys High) clashed in their last match of the season a few metres away from the stadium. People came out in large numbers to witness the game between the arch-rivals. Among them was Willem van der Walt, who predicted that Affies would win. “Affies is the best in rugby. Everyone here knows what is going to come out from this game; we are just here to see how they win, not if they win - it is like taking a candy from a baby,” he said. Both rugby stands were packed with supporters from each team, with each group singing their lungs out, cheering and showing support for their team. After all was said and done, as predicted by many, Affies came out victorious, with the score 62-20. At Loftus, meanwhile, Sundowns and their Soweto opponents played to an entertaining 1-all draw. Khanya Bolo, who supported Boys High, said both teams played well, and that he paid attention to his side’s number 10. “We heard that the number 10 had something special to offer and I must admit, he came through for his team. “He inspired his teammates not to give up and keep pushing,” he said. Bolo played for Parktown Boys High School in his time and said seeing pupils from each school cheering and singing reminded him of his time at the Joburg north school.
