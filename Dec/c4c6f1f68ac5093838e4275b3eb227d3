Scandal villain character Mthunzi Mayisa might have had viewers hot under the collar for a while, but Samson has been giving them some amusement lately. Samson Ngema, a charming young pastor who wreaks havoc to some unassuming characters on the show has most viewers glued to the screen. And frankly speaking, viewers have forgotten about Mthunzi - who has since been out of the picture following all the drama at his wedding. Now the television soapie has a new character stirring up viewers’ emotions. The role is played by 24-year-old actor Mpho Sibeko who previously had a recurring role on the soapie Rhythm City as headboy. He joined the cast two months ago as Mlungisi Ngema’s nephew (real name Patrick Mofokeng). Samson is very spiritual, progressive and ambitious at heart, who converts everyone into believers who invest in his faith and church. He is also a shapeshifter who speaks the language of the youth and understands the pressures they face,however, there’s a dark side to this seemingly charming young pastor. He roams the streets wearing his white church gown holding the bible preaching and sometimes selling what he calls "anointing oil." He recently managed to convince Safe ‘n Clean workers to dedicate their lunch time to listening to the word of God, while they fork out money for offerings. But lately, viewers have been taking to Twitter to talk about a side of him they believe is fake. But despite that being the case, most viewers are left in stitches when ever he appears on their screens.  #etvScandal wuuu Samson😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/95qmHvpSlr Samson #etvScandal pic.twitter.com/sJ1DJvjdjO Heeeeeee wadla Samson, inyoka🐍 ikhishwa ngenyoka🍆😂😂😂😂😂 #etvscandal pic.twitter.com/LaRtegGRm6 All I hope for is that Pastor Samson’s storyline becomes an eye opener to the real situations people find themselves in out there in the real world #etvScandal If #etvScandal doesn't show Phindile and Rorisang in such a scenario in Samson's church, they're wasting everybody's time.cc @MphoSibeko__ @iam_nozuko pic.twitter.com/FpbsY0QsTT Lol the level of faith and confidence Samson has @etvScandal 😂😂#etvScandal pic.twitter.com/EA5WfjgQuc Javas is correct, Phindile is naive.
