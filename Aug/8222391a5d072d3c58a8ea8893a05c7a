The Grade 12 Cornwall Hill College pupil has been named the "ambassador" for Positive Sports Solutions and told the Pretoria News she was looking forward to the challenge. The teenage cyclist has been a leading rider in the Gauteng Schools Spur series for the past five years and was women’s captain last year in the province. Her earliest cycling memories were of riding in muddy races with her father, but Britz has become a star in her own right. “I started riding with my dad just for fun and some of his friends. “I begged him after that to do a couple of races. I enjoyed being out in nature, being free, and able to push myself. "It was the innocence of going out with family and friends, meeting new people and learning of their views and drive for the sport that ignited all this passion for cycling.” She said after horse riding for a while, she started taking cycling seriously when she was in Grade 5. Britz said her love for riding was in mountain biking and the exciting part was the different obstacles on the route, such as rock gardens, drop-offs and gap jumps. “The whole vibe is interesting - the most exciting thing about road racing is the speed and the different tactics within the teams. It is not all about riding and who is the fastest.” She said she approached Positive Sports Solutions. “I wanted to not just associate myself with them, but also try help their brand grow. In return I get to test their amazing products and market them." Positive Sports Solutions distributes bikes, bike carriers, wheels and bike components. Britz said her goals for this year were to race internationally again and represent the country in the world championships in Austria next month. When she is done with matric, she plans to study psychology at the University of Pretoria. During the holidays, she wants to ride in Europe as guest rider on various teams. “In the long term I would like to cycle for a professional women’s team and be a regular rider on the international scene."
