Police officers and police staff executing non-core functions in police offices took to the streets of the capital to picket over various grievances this afternoon. The Police, Prisons and Civil Rights Union (Popcru) encouraged the crowd to take part in numerous demonstrations during their lunchtime as a build-up to a big march to the Union Buildings on Friday. Popcru Tshwane chairperson Thomas Hlongwane said the union expected at least 20 000 of its national members to gather in Pretoria for a massive grievances march. These demonstrations are expected to raise challenges experienced by the union's members working in the police, correctional services and traffic departments. Protesters plan to submit three memorandums to Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, advocate Thabang Masutla, and Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande.

In a media briefing, Hlongwane said, the union also wanted to convince government to nationalise traffic departments so that each metro or province did not have an independent traffic department. Independent departments, he explained, brought inequalities in salaries and benefits among traffic officers doing the same work. “We will also be calling for a once-off promotion for all members with at least 10 years of experience in the police, traffic police and correctional services. These promotions should come with a salary increase. It does not make sense to have police officers and prison warders doing the same work under one rank for more than 10 years. That is not good for morale or their development,” The crowd sang outside their office near Church Square. They held placards and sang for 30 minutes before returning to work.
