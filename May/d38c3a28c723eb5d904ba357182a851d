JAMES MAHLOKWANE Pretoria’s Freedom Park couldn’t have been a more suitable venue to celebrate Africaness and activate Africa Month programmes and activities. It was lights, camera and action at the heritage site when deputy minister of Arts and Culture, Maggie Sotyu, led the activation themed, The Year of Nelson Mandela: Building a better Africa and a better World. It wasn’t long before the women reminded the audience of the pivotal roles women play when they rolled up their sleeves and decided to help bring peace and freedom in African countries in times of unrest. The women sang praises for "strong African women" who carried their families and communities on their backs without being on the spotlight for far to long. They quickly reminded the men in the audience to not to forget heroines such as mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Sotyu said the Department of Arts and Culture was concerned that as the nation moved forward with time, it could find itself forgetting mama Albertina Sisulu and only remembering Nelson Mandela and that would not be just. She would mention Sisulu in every part of her speech where Mandela was mentioned as a token of respect to "Imbokoto" (strong women) and a sign of "practicing what you preach". Audience members came dressed to kill in their colourful and vivid African clothing. Their fashion was complemented by well dressed hosts who held up high numerous colourful African flags at Freedom Park. Delegates and dignitaries included Department of Arts and Culture Director-General Vusimuzi Mkhize, dean of African ambassadors and ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Congo,  Ben Mpoko, and keynote speaker, Algeria ambassador  Abd-El-Naceur Belaid. Freedom Park Chief Executive, Jane Mufamadi, proudly welcomed the presence of Freedom Park ambassadors, who also happened to be world-renowned musicians and struggle icons, Caiphus Semenya, Letta Mbuli and Yvonne Chaka Chaka.
