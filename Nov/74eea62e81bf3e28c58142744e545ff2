Pretoria - The Police, Prisons and Civil Rights Union's (Popcru) Tshwane membership celebrated when a police brigadier appeared in court for allegedly assaulting one of their shop stewards in 2016. Brigadier Lucky Mabule finally appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court for a case that was opened against him by angry union members who wanted him dismissed. Popcru secretary in Tshwane Herman Motshegoa led the group that expressed relief to see Mabule appearing in court for possible prosecution for a case that was opened in 2016. They claimed that Mabule used his influence to avoid prosecution for a long time for this case and another one where he allegedly assaulted police colonel Sello Motau in 2015. They said the Motau case has not been heard in court to date. The Pretoria Magistrate's Court released Mabule on warning after he brought himself to court. His council decided not to comment on the matter until the National Prosecuting Authority issues them a court docket on November 27 when he's due for his next appearance. Speaking outside court, Popcru stewards Frans Chaane, said Mabule attacked him back in February of 2016 trying to remove him from a meeting in his office. He said Mabule wanted to chase him and another shop steward, Malose Seanego, out of the meeting. Motshegoa said Popcru believed that Mabule should be dismissed from the South African Police Services because an official who was violent should not be working in a department that issued firearms licenses. He said Mabule himself should not be allowed to carry a firearm should the court find him guilty.
