Seven Eersterust residents arrested for various crimes including theft, public violence and possession of a firearm during community service delivery protests are expected to appear at the Pretoria Magistrates Court this morning. Eersterust police officers arrested the seven suspects with 12 other co-accused during the demonstrations that took place two weeks ago. However, these seven were denied the mercy of the court last week when the 12 co-accused were released on warning. The #EersterustSeven is alleged to have committed the crimes that warrant prosecution. Some of them will be charged for allegedly ransacking the Eersterust police station and stealing a TV and computer monitors. A police firearm was reported stolen following the police station's attack. Subsequently, the police condemned the attack on police premises and asked community members who have information to come forward and help catch the culprits. However, friends and family members of the accused said they were angry and disappointed that the police "randomly" arrested a group of young men from the streets closest to the Eersterust police station instead of arresting the real culprits. The police, however, insisted that the arrests were intelligence driven and that the suspects were traced and found in possession of the stolen items. The police were confident they made good arrests and the justice system could prosecute the alleged offenders. Barney Williams is in court with other friends family member to support his 19-year-old grandson. He said the police did not arrest his grandson in possession of any of the items he was suspected to have stolen. Other families who were in court said they were worried that the community of Eersterust did not show up to court to support them. They said things were intense at home without family members in police custody but were confident they could eventually be acquitted.
