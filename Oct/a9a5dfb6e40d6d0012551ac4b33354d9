One of the oldest forms of safety is the gated community, and few would argue against the efficiency of having a guard stationed at a little office manning a boom gate that restricts access. But access control comes at a huge cost for the residents of affected areas. Residents Against Crime has approached the high court, asking that the fees for gated communities in Tshwane be reviewed. The organisation has a valid point - but so has the municipality. A few weeks ago, the Pretoria News published details of the application, and on the front page today is the response from the City of Tshwane. In it, the City argues that the fees were determined by a number of factors, and denies that they are exorbitant. The outcome of this case will go a long way towards determining the exact cost of safety, using the oldest method of crime deterrent in the book, in the country. On Friday, the Pretoria News ran a story on the front page with the headline “Msimanga 2, ANC 0”, implying that the official opposition had lost a second motion of no-confidence against executive mayor Solly Msimanga. It has since emerged that the motion had been tabled in August, but could not proceed at the time and had been carried over to the September sitting of the council. - Kennedy Mudzuli (assistant editor)
