Roto (9.95 seconds) is one of only five South African sprinters to have dipped under 10 seconds in the 100m, while Mamatu won the silver medal in the 100m for the past two years at the South African Championships. After a frustrating two years in which she was constantly injured, Mamatu is looking forward to racing. Roto predicts that she is capable of getting close or even improving on her best time of 11.27. Mamatu’s biggest frustration is that she seldom gets to be pushed to the limit in local races. “The only time I know I am in for a tight race is when Carina Horn is racing. Unfortunately, that does not happen often. We usually only get to race each other at the national championships. It means I miss out getting used to being at a competitive edge. “It would be great if we can reach a stage in South African women’s sprinting like the men. At any race, there are five or more of them that are capable of running 10.15 and faster, so there is no resting on 
one’s laurels.” Achilles tendinitis prevented Roto  from running earlier this season, and he will be eager to resume competition. “I am excited to see what I am capable of at the moment. For the moment, I am not even thinking about sub-10 seconds. I know it can happen at any time as I have trained with the likes of Clarence Munyai and Thembo Monareng. I am capable of keeping up with them, which shows I am in good form.” - African News Agency (ANA)
