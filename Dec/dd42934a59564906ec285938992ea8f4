Meteorologist Victoria Nurse said temperatures from today start low but go higher. Every day is expected to be partly cloud until Thursday, but there will be thunderstorms between Friday and Sunday, she said. The higher temperatures for the week left the Department of Water and Sanitation concerned about the country’s water dam levels. Meanwhile, the City has warned residents about increased water interruptions owing to an electrical problem at Rand Water’s Palmiet pump station. “Rand Water is continuously monitoring the reservoirs, which reached unacceptable levels this past weekend. Residents and the business community throughout the City are urged to use water sparingly.” The City also called for the prudent use of water following restrictions by Rand Water. An increase in use resulted in a shortage of bulk water supply in the metro. The City restricted watering gardens between 6am and 6pm. James Mahlokwane
