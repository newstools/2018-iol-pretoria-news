First up is The Illusionists at the Teatro at Montecasino, followed by Dynamo at Time Square Sun Arena in May. After a run in Cape Town, The Illusionists, the best selling magic show on Broadway, plays at Monte from February 14 to March 11, with shows daily bar Monday. Collectively the eight performers who make up The Illusionists have been seen by millions of people around the world and this production showcases their incredible talents together on stage for the very first time. Audiences will witness stunning acts of grand illusion, levitation, mind reading, and disappearance in a show which takes its cue from great illusionists of the past, but with a contemporary aesthetic that promises to leave local audiences enthralled. Dynamo - or Steven Frayne - is known to TV audiences for his show Magician Impossible which airs in 180 territories worldwide. He will be visiting South Africa with his Seeing is Believing Live Tour. “We are excited to welcome Dynamo to South Africa. It will give his many fans the opportunity to see his magic skills in what is a spectacular and unique live stage production,” says Showtime’s Tony Feldman. After four seasons of his TV show Dynamo decided to take his show to a live stage and has not looked back. Dynamo’s approach to large scale illusion (the big stunts are never pre-publicised and use well known landmarks as their backdrop) has allowed him to connect with young people and re-energise the genre in a way not seen for a generation. Such is the appetite for his style of illusion that a 10-date run has turned into a year-long world tour as Dynamo spread his magic and filled arenas playing 127 shows with over 600000 plus tickets sold. He has promised that he will “amaze” fans in South Africa. He will stage three shows in Pretoria - on May 11, two on May 12 and one on May 13 - before heading for Cape Town. Tickets are on sale at Computicket.
