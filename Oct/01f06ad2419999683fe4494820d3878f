The organisation remains unhappy about delays and cancellation of the train services theft and vandalism and commuter safety. Chairperson Paul Mohale said the problem needed to be addressed at its highest level. He said Transport Minister Blade Nzimande needed to pull his weight and fix the shenanigans at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) in order to restore faith among commuters. “We have come to an era where Prasa is struggling to to have running trains. The operational system has collapsed and the timetables have become decorations on the Metrorail boards,” he said. The worst decision that Metrorail took was to reduce security, which left the service vulnerable, Mohale said. “Reduced security on trains has left the commuters at the mercy of armed criminals. It’s a wonder that the drivers can still move trains without being killed because trains have become soft targets and a haven for criminals.” He said Metrorail assets were not protected; it was for this reason that most trains no longer had windows and had graffiti on them. “As we embark on this Transport Month, we request Prasa and the department to consider getting funding or re-look at budgets and come up with an accelerated infrastructure programme that will address the challenges,” he said. He also suggested that security guards be brought on to platforms, which would ultimately reduce vandalism and fare evasion. “Protect your commuters by having mobile units on the trains to safeguard them, especially on late and off-peak trains which are often targets of criminals. “The mobile units will protect your personnel also as they operate in unsafe conditions.”
