"As the aviation historical hub of the SAAF, the unit continues in its endeavors of collecting, restoring, preserving and exhibiting articles as well as records pertaining to the heritage and traditions of the SAAF and military aviation. Members of the public are assured of a great airshow this weekend," said SAAF museum commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Bruintjies. He said members of the public can expect different aircraft on the day and some that are included are: Oryx, Agusta 109, Gripen, Hawk and the Rooivalk. Aircraft from the museum include Harvard, Atlas C4m Kudu and Vampire. Due to the different aircraft scheduled to take part at the show, Bruintjies pleaded with residents in Centurion, Valhalla and other neighbouring suburbs to be tolerant as there was going to be a lot of noise and traffic congestion. He said: "There will be traffic congestion and excessive aircraft noise, we therefore appeal for tolerance and understanding from the public especially residents of Valhalla, Centurion and other surrounding areas." Bruintjies anticipated a great day ahead and urged citizens to attend and also buy tickets prior to the show rather than at the gate. Tickets are available at computicket outlets for R80 and there is free entry for children under 16 years.
