Arriving on Saturday after a tough final loop, the team narrowly beat the Tokai University Solar Car team, which completed 3941.4km. The nine solar cars received much attention as they navigated through the 18 towns on the route. Locals took pictures of the cars and drivers, while some just watched in awe. A “gig rig” also tagged along, entertaining and informing children about engineering opportunities. The Sasol Solar Challenge is held every second year as a testament to the power of science, engineering, maths and technology. On their journey through South Africa, the solar cars become travelling laboratories, demonstrating to schools at each stop what a practical application of those subjects can achieve. The Swiss Solar Energy Racers finished third, completing 2642.1km. The team’s cockpit cover sustained damage early in the eight-day challenge, but was repaired overnight. The students rallied and still managed a comfortable 300km lead over the next car. In the local battle, Tshwane University of Technology’s Sun Chaser 3 finished an impressive 2397km, 120.7km more than North West University’s car, Phoenix. The Tshwane team also had a tough first day, with their solar panel blowing off on the road to Kroonstad and having to be significantly rebuilt. High school team Sonke covered an admirable 656.9km with its first solar car, something it hopes to repeat if it can find sponsorship. The pupils, aged 14 to 18, built all elements of the vehicle under the guidance of team manager and teacher Rob Lodge. City University from Hong Kong were the sole competitor in the Sustainability class, for which charging is allowed, and completed 175.5km. Their hyper-realistic car, Reysol, was a crowd-pleasing addition to the event this year, and they aim to use the experience to return in 2020 with a much-improved vehicle.
