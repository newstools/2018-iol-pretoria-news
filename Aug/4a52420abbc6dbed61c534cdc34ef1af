A tip-off from residents led to the arrest of two people found in possession of the species at the Rustenburg minibus taxi tank. Police say preliminary investigations found that the suspects were about to sell the pangolin for R20000. It was worth an estimated R400000. “The animal was allegedly stolen and brought to Rustenburg on Wednesday, August 1. “The suspects had the animal inside a plastic bag and were about to leave with it in a taxi when the Phokeng stock theft unit pounced,” said Captain Elsabé Augoustides. “The pangolin is regarded as one of the world's most sought-after endangered species. It was handed over for safekeeping to an animal expert, responsible for its transportation to the Hospital for Vulnerable Animals in Johannesburg. “It is believed that pangolins, whose whole bodies are covered in scales, are caught due to unfounded beliefs of the great medicinal value of their scales,” said Augoustides. The accused, Surprise Moyani Nkomezulu, 25, and Tlhobogang Daniel Mantsho, 34, appeared in the Rustenburg Magistrate's Court last Friday and were released on R2500 bail each. They are back in court on August 31. Rustenburg policing cluster commander Major-General Arthur Adams commended the officers of the stock theft unit for their reaction that led to the rescue of the pangolin and apprehension of the two accused. Nature conservation was everyone's priority and police would ensure that endangered species were fiercely protected, he said. Adams lauded residents for their contribution to the success.
