Yesterday, he said Impact Radio donated 500 new bomber jackets, 600 beanies and 600 gloves during its Winter Night Drive at the weekend. The Pretoria Progressive Jewish Congregation also donated bags of warm clothing. All donations went to the homeless people of Princess Park, Potter’s House and the Koffie Huis. “The homeless people who received these items were so happy, and even now they keep telling me how appreciative they are. Previously, I said people liked saying if you give something to homeless people they will sell it; that is not the case, as they value the items that we hand them.” Giddy Lies, a member of the Pretoria Progressive Jewish Congregation, said: “It is a worthy cause, the people at synagogue saw it as a good outreach project. We even decided to keep our relationship with the forum, we will continue helping them.” Victoria Sibiya of Impact Radio, a Christian community radio station based in Pretoria, said the idea to do a winter campaign came while she was driving and saw a man who was hardly dressed in the inner city. The next day at work she pitched the idea to give jackets to homeless people. “We have an annual winter campaign and already had the idea to give the jackets to homeless people, but our initial idea was to randomly give them away. But when I saw an article in the  Pretoria News I saw the need to work with people who knew the situation homeless people were in and where to find them.” She said they wanted to impact the city by impacting the people. Mpufane called on the public to continue donating blankets and clothing: “To all the people who have reached out, we appreciate what you have done because it goes a long way,” the one-time street homeless person  said.
