Pretoria - A grandmother is claiming R1.1million for post-traumatic stress after her mentally ill son escaped from a hospital and was killed when he ran in front of a truck. Granny Johanna Masilela, 90, who lives in Vlaklaagte village in Mpumalanga is blaming Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi for her loss. She said in papers before the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, that if the staff at the Kwamhlanga Hospital kept an eye on her son, the tragedy would not have happened. Johannes Jiyani, who had been a psychiatric patient for years, was admitted to the hospital on October 14, 2011, after he had cut himself with a knife. His niece Dudu Ntuli accompanied him to hospital. She was later told that he had absconded and was hit by a truck at the hospital gates. He had died of his injuries. The hospital said it had nothing to do with his death as it involved a car accident. The trial has been postponed indefinitely. Pretoria News
