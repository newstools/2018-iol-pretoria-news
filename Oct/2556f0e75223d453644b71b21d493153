This was after their case was withdrawn at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court this week. The guards were arrested and subsequently released on R500 bail each at the time. Police believed they were behind public violence, including the burning of tyres and throwing stones on the day. Their legal representative, Andries Nkome, confirmed that the guards would file lawsuits against the state for unlawful arrests. He said his clients wanted compensation because they had lived under a cloud after they were charged with public violence. “They should be compensated for the time they spent going to court for something they didn’t do,” Nkome said. His clients had 90 days to write a letter that would confirm their instruction to him to pursue a case on their behalf. “The state could not prove allegations brought against them that they committed public violence.” During the protest many guards sustained injuries when metro police officers fired rubber bullets to disperse them while they engaged in an illegal strike. Their protest was staged as a result of a call by the municipality to replace them with metro police officers. They also demanded to be employed permanently in the municipality. The jobs of the guards were under threat after the City expressed its intention to withdraw the services of private security companies that employed them. In September, the City took a decision to in-source 4000 security guards. The City also resolved that all posts must be advertised, but the guards expressed their discontent about the decision, saying it risked having most of them out of work
