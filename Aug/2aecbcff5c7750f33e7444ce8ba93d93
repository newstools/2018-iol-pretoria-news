EFF Student Command members from Durban and Tshwane have gathered at the Union Buildings to support Bonginkosi Khanyile who was arrested during #FeesMustFall protests. The group of young students have partnered with Bonginkosi's mother to stage a sleep-out at the Union Buildings until President Ramaphosa comes to speak to them and hear their plight. They want Ramaphosa to use his powers and influence to give all students arrested during #FeesMustFall protests between 2015 and 2016 amnesty.

For that reason, they believed their alleged crimes are not serious compared to the crimes committed by a lot of people during apartheid. Some of the students who will be sleeping at the Unions Building travelled all the way from KwaZulu-Natal by bus.
