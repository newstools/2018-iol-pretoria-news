Mkhari had promised residents that all shacks erected illegally on an open space within the area earlier this year would be removed by September. The community started complaining that despite several engagements with the City, the shacks were still there and depreciating the value of their investments. The illegal dwellers clashed with the residents in August, prompting police to fire stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The informal settlers were adamant that they would not leave Morula View. They urged their wealthier neighbours to relocate to Sandton if they couldn’t tolerate shacks near their houses. Yesterday Mkhari said: “I have given Morula View residents my word that the City is determined to remove all illegal shacks and across the rest of Tshwane. A contractor was appointed and we are just waiting for the Tshwane metro police department to submit a report to the mayoral committee. “The report will deal with the issues of funding the execution of the evictions. This is going to cost millions because evictions will take place across all of Tshwane in areas like Atteridgeville, Soshanguve, Ga-Rankuwa and Mamelodi, to mention a few.” Mkhari said he could not give specific dates for the official evictions, but said there was a high probability that more than 60000 illegal shacks could be removed by the end of this year. Morula View residents committee chairperson Mhlonishwa Khoza said the City was not taking their grievances seriously enough because the problem was getting worse each month. “Residents are living in fear and their hard-earned investments are being threatened by the land invaders who are saying they will burn our houses because they have nothing to lose. “We were promised at several meetings that the land invaders will be removed, but to this day nothing has happened. Now it looks like the municipality favours land invasion,” said Khoza.
