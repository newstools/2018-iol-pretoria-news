The reigning continental and domestic league champions said fans wearing the Sundowns regalia would be allowed free entry to the stadium. For those who don’t have the club kit, the entry fee is R20. The Brazilians will need all the support they can get against AS Togo-Port. The match starts at 9pm. Masandawana are trailing at the bottom of the group and need to win this crucial match to stay afloat. Coach Pitso Mosimane said they needed all the backing and encouragement they could get from their supporters to pull through the clash. After going down 1-0 to the same team in Lome last week, Sundowns must to win to stay alive in the tournament. The city giants have just three points from two matches. The team’s display improved in the pre-season Shell Helix Ultra Cup last weekend. Sundowns defeated Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 in that game, and Mosimane will be hoping for more of the same in front of their home fans. Sundowns will be looking to flex new guns, like Andile Jali, Lyle Lakay, Jose Ali Meza, Katlego Otladisa, Toni Silva and Tristan Moses, who recently joined the club. Siphelele Mkhulise was also promoted to the first team.
