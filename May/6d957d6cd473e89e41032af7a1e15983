The British High Commissioner, Nigel Casey, and his wife Clare, hosted hundreds of guests - including diplomats from the US and Commonwealth countries - for a garden party at their residence in Waterkloof. Many women dressed up for the occasion with heels and hats while a few men came in kilts. Under the cool grey sky, the guests gathered on the lawns and balcony, taking selfies against various backdrops including Windsor Castle and a wall of pastel roses - and watching proceedings on a large TV screen, or another TV set inside. There was friendly banter around the outdoor bar with drinks on offer, including Sani wine, the first to be developed in Lesotho and presented as a gift to Prince Harry by his friend Prince Seeiso. Staff glided between the groups with trays of snacks and lemon sponge cake with elderflower syrup, similar to that chosen by the royal couple for their wedding. In his welcome, Casey proposed a toast to the Queen and said permission for the celebration of her grandson’s marriage and her own 92nd birthday (officially celebrated on June 9) took place with her permission. He said it was fitting the wedding was celebrated in South Africa as the couple’s love had been made “under Southern African skies” - with Prince Harry spending a life-changing year in Lesotho, and having brought Meghan to Botswana. It was also an appropriate venue as Meghan was American and the US residence is next door to the British.
