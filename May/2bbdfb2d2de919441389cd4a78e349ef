Learners were in the morning addressed by senior personnel from the participating museums and institutions prior to exhibitions and educational tours. International Museum Day was established by the International Council of Museums in 1977 to increase public awareness of the role of museums in the development of society. Momentum has been increasing unabated ever since. Among the schools were learners from Westview Primary School. Sibusiso Luphakela, a grade 4 pupil from the school said he enjoyed himself as he learned about the history of where he came from.
