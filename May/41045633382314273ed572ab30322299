Participants formed an hour-long pro-life chain on Saturday and held placards with messages such as “Abortion: God calls it murder” and “One dead, one wounded”. Wearing black and white T-shirts, the group caused traffic congestion as motorists stopped to read the 
messages. Small children also formed part of the chain and distributed pamphlets to motorists and passers-by. The organisation is a platform for pro-life organisations, churches and individuals with the aim to let the voice of all pro-lifers in South Africa be heard. Herald Thiede of the Biblical Christian Network said their action was intended to make it clear that abortion was wrong and not a 
solution. “This thing is wrong and we’ve got to stand up against it. “We do accept that it is not easy. The situation that women find themselves in is very difficult, but do we now kill to solve this problem, or do we rather support these women? “Every day 1900 babies are aborted. Babies must be given their rights to live and we can’t just get rid of them because it might an economic burden or a social problem.There must be a better solution than to kill them,” he said. “There are many reasons leading to women getting rid of unborn babies but the government makes it legal and this gives you an option to go that way. But we think there shouldn’t be that option,” he added. “I wouldn’t say it’s the cause but it makes it easier for someone to take that decision which we feel is wrong,” he said. One of the organisers, Dieter Claassen, said abortion had been normalised as if it was not wrong. “Society is insensitive towards the plight of the unborn. “It’s like it just washes off and nobody cares anymore. We are in shock if we see an accident and somebody is killed, but if somebody walks past and says they are off to do an abortion nobody cares.
