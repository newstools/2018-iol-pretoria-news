Over the last few years the Capital Craft Beer Festival has established itself as an indispensable part of Pretoria’s social calendar. It is a not-to-be-missed event, as it sets the bar for the industry, with over 40 brewers expected to be there. There will also be ample entertainment and a massive variety of food to choose from. The venue itself offers so many cosy corners for the perfect opportunity to meet the brewers and make new friends, in a beautiful atmosphere and ambiance. There will be three music stages, one comedy stage, two Firestone Karaoke Kombis, and over 200 varieties of beer on tap. Food and educational stalls will also be in abundance, and parents can bring their little ones to have fun in the kids' area. The Clamber Club party obstacle course and equipment will be set up in the kiddies' entertainment area. The festival promises to be a well-executed and unforgettable experience, featuring comedians, the likes of Prodgers Comedy, KG Mokgadi, Glen Biderman Pam, Alfred Adriaan, Long John the Comedian, Nqoba “King Nqoba” Ngcobo and Dillan Oliphant, who will take to the stage to help those in attendance enjoy their beer. The Firestone Karaoke Kombi campaign will involve two Volkswagen Kombis, one a classic 1972 VW Brasília Kombi and the other a brand new one, converted into mobile karaoke studios. The Brasília Kombi is host to the large catalogue of old-school songs, while its newer sibling features the best of modern karaoke songs. The Springboks against England game will be screened on the main stage and the World Cup football at the Hillbilly Hoedown stage.
