At the same time, the City also informed residents of Hammans-
kraal and nearby areas supplied by the Temba Water Purification Plant that the water quality was safe to drink and for any other use. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said the restrictions were relaxed following the recent above-average rainfall in the Integrated Vaal River System catchment area. That brought relief for the City and other municipalities relying on Rand Water, which extracts raw water from the Vaal system. The City announced it would partially lift water restrictions from May 8, 2017. This followed the proclamation by the Department of Water and Sanitation about the complete lifting of water restrictions on March 13, 2017,” Mashigo said. “The City’s residents are encouraged to continue to utilise water in a far more effective and efficient way. The water conservation measures implemented during the initial restrictions should remain the norm." Mashigo also said the cable theft incident at the Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant in June, which led to the disturbance of the operational system, had been replaced. The Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant relays water to the Temba Water Purification Plant from which communities in and around Hammans-
kraal receive water. “The water supplied in these areas meets the minimum required standards. “In the event of abnormalities the City will address those deviations immediately,” he added.
