The onset of the disease has made it difficult for him to travel and perform on a large-scale, a statement on the site said, adding that he would be cancelling upcoming concert dates in Australia and New Zealand and offering refunds for funds. “It is with great reluctance and disappointment that I announce my retirement from concert touring. “I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,” Diamond said, offering apologies to those who purchased tickets to his upcoming shows. Diamond, known for hits including Sweet Caroline and Cracklin’ Rosie, said he planned to remain active in song writing and recording. Diamond turns 77 today and on Sunday the Recording Academy plans to honour him with its Lifetime Achievement Award. Diamond has sold more than 130million albums worldwide and 38 of his singles have made it to the Top 40, according to the academy. Grammy-award winner Diamond, a fixture in American pop music since he began recording in the 1960s, has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world. You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement,” Diamond said. “This ride has been ‘so good, so good, so good’, thanks to you.”  - Reuters
