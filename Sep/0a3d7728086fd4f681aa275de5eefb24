The two winners - “The Betties” or Pretoria High School for Girls, and “The Okes” or Pretoria High School for Boys - will battle it out with six other schools from three other regions for top honours and more than R20000 in prizes in the inaugural National High School Quiz with IIE Varsity College on September27. From early Saturday morning it was all systems go at Varsity College, Pretoria, with pupils cramming in some last-minute knowledge, paging through numerous editions of the Pretoria News. The tension inside the intimate venue could be cut with a knife, as 11 groups, including Willow Ridge High School, Crawford College and Pretoria Chinese School, tried to outsmart each other. The competition was very tight, with single and half points separating the teams.  Quiz master and editor of the Pretoria News, Val Boje, also turned it up a notch from the first round, by asking gruelling questions. The categories included current affairs, politics, sport, business and entertainment from editions of the Pretoria News. Minchia Valley from Girls High accredited their success to all their hard work and studying, coupled with supportive teachers. “I am so excited that we made it to the nationals; it's surreal. We need to keep the focus and study even harder,” she said. A member of the Boys High team, Okuhle Nyangtsimbi, said they were flabbergasted by the victory, considering that they had been on a camp for three days before the regional competition. “We had it hard, yet here we are, ready for the next lap,” he said.
