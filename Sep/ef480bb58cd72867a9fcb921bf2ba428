“Since the appointment of a new service provider to manage the wi-fi operation with effect from August 1, more than 600 sites out of a total of 1051 sites, are up and running - which translates to more than 58% of the sites where the service has been restored,” he said. “When the new service provider took over from the previous one, Project Isizwe, their immediate task was to assess the current network and assets to provide an intensive implementation and maintenance plan.” He said teams from both the City and the new service provider then began the process of assessing the network operation centre, infrastructure, high sites and hotspots to address operational challenges and for a smooth transition. “Some of the problems we encountered were due to non-connectivity at the Wapadrand substation that got burnt down about two months ago. “Theft and vandalism of our infrastructure in places like Mamelodi, Soshanguve and other areas have also largely contributed to the delay.” Bokaba said vandalism of infrastructure was a recurring nightmare which affects a myriad of services such as power and water supply and now provision of wi-fi service. “The team is busy bringing high sites to live and we are gradually expecting more sites to be live as we ramp up the restoration process.” During this transition period, any service concerns and outages related to free wi-fi should be sent to tshwanefreewifi@tshwane.gov.za. - Staff Reporter
