Although some expected clouds of smoke to be drifting from bongs, coupled with reggae music and tie-dyed shirts, most appreciated the educational aspect of it. Thousands attended the four-day event to learn about the versatile cannabis plant, which has a huge variety of uses, and is making waves globally in industries across the business spectrum. Attendees, both young and old, circled the various exhibitions, which were creative with their presentations. One particular stall that was inundated with customers was the Cannabis Energy Drink Stall, and owner Shaneen Osman said people were intrigued by the energy drink and its different flavours and could not get enough of it. It was described as having the standard energy drink flavour, but with added cannabis extract. This extract is derived from the hemp seed, and has no Tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC. Another hit was the stall that sold cannabis beer called “Durban Poison”. It was such a hit that halfway through the event on Sunday, they were cleaned out. Other stalls ranged from systems on how to cultivate pure cannabis, types of lights to use, oils and creams and clothes made from hemp to cannabis infused ice cream. Some attendees also waited to get an airbrush tattoo of marijuana leafs at the Airvolution Body stall. Also on offer were dog biscuits that are high in the non-psychoactive cannabidiol extract. At R130 a bag, they were said to help with digestion, inhibit tumour growth, and promised to make dogs less prone to over-react to fireworks. Clarissa Louw said the expo was an important first step, which opened up an interesting discourse. “People are now aware of the different roles cannabis can play in one’s life. For far too long cannabis was stereotyped as just for “stoners” and “potheads”. Jason Groenewald said he expected more. “I felt they catered for mass growers and farmers, not us, the people,” he said. The event will be hosted annually around the country's major centres.
