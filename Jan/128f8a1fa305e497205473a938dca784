Excitement for the show, produced by Bernard Jay at the Joburg Theatre, is high, with the cast receiving a letter of support from Oprah Winfrey, who said there was no better time to tell this story in South Africa. Jay spent four years negotiating for the rights and preparing for the show, and promises that “South African audiences will laugh, will cry, will cheer”... and will never forget The Color Purple. The Color Purple, based on a novel by Alice Walker, tells the story of a woman who, through love, finds the strength to triumph over adversity and discover her unique voice in the world. Steven Spielberg directed the 1985 film version which starred Winfrey. The award-winning musical was written by Marsha Norman, with music and lyrics by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray. The joyous score features jazz, ragtime, gospel and blues and is, ultimately, a celebration of life. Award-winning director Janice Honeyman leads the South African creative team, with musical direction by Rowan Bakker, choreography by Oscar Buthelezi, production design by Sarah Roberts, lighting design by Mannie Manim and sound design by Richard Smith. The cast features the following talented performers (in alphabetical order): Zane Gillion, Didintle Khunou, Sebe Leotlela, Dolly Louw, Andile Magxaki, Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri, Venolia Manale, Namisa Mdlalose, Phumi Mncayi, Neo Motaung, Lerato Mvelase, Tshepo Ncokoane, Thokozani Nzima, Funeka Peppeta, Aubrey Poo, Senzesihle Radebe, Lelo Ramasimong, Zolani Shangase, Ayanda Sibisi and Lebo Toko.
