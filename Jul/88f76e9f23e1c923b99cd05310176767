Last year City Property staff packed over 72 000 meals, but this year the company challenged it's staff to pack 100 000 meals for every year since Madiba’s birth for underprivileged children in the city at 012central. Head of Human resources Heather Prinsloo said staff packed meals to contribute their 67 minutes ahead of Mandela Day with 100 000 small gestures to thank Madiba for inspiring them to make a difference. City Property are celebrating what would have been his 100th birthday. Prinsloo said the packing was not only their way of celebrating the good that Mandela taught the country but a way for staff to make an impact and build their relationship creating team cohesion. "We are thankful to be able to help change the world for the better.  These 100 000 meals will never be enough, but each meal will make a difference.” Staff packed the nutritionally balanced meals in shifts of 67 minutes, while listening and jamming to South African music. City Property CEO Jeffrey Wapnick told his staff before packing of the importance of packing the meals. He said while packing they should keep in mind the amount of happiness they will bring to the children. The property management company will again work with international hunger relief organisation, Rise Against Hunger. Several meal packs will be distributed on Mandela Day.
