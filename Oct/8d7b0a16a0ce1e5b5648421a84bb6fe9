The two men appeared briefly in court following their arrest on Monday. They allegedly tried to rob the service station adjacent to the Denlyn Shopping Centre. The two suspects were arrested when Tshwane Metro Police Department officers responded to a robbery in progress. A gunbattle ensued between the suspects and two metro officers. The third suspect was fatally shot by officers, and 93 cartridges found following the altercation. One of the suspects, a Zimbabwean male who allegedly works for Fidelity Security, reportedly had a valid passport. However, his legal representative failed to produce the documents. The State requested that the documentation be furnished when the duo made their next appearance. The men are facing charges of illegal possession of firearms, illegal possession of ammunition, robbery with aggravating circumstances and murder. Police are also on the lookout for more suspects as it is believed more than five people were involved. The Metro Police are also conducting internal investigations following the recovery of its firearm. The case was postponed to Monday.
