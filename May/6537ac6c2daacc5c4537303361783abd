His eldest son Thulani Nzima said on Saturday his father collapsed on May 10 at their old home in the same village, about 5km away from the new house. “He was sorting out the keys to the house when he collapsed. My father was happy for the house. He particularly liked the balcony for the fresh air. He also posed for a number of pictures in many parts of this house,” Thulani said. The house had three bedrooms, a lounge, kitchen, and two garages, and was built on a piece of land belonging to Nzima, he said. Nzima died on May 12 at Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela after a short illness. He was 83. He is best known for capturing the famous picture of Mbuyisa Makhubu carrying Hector Pieterson after he was shot during the 1976 Soweto uprisings. Thulani said his mother Thelma Nzima continued with the preparations to move into the house after her husband was admitted to hospital. He said his father had been earning most of his income by renting out a property consisting of a liquor shop and a butchery, which is situated in the yard of their old home in the village. Addressing mourners during Nzima’s funeral on Saturday, Mabuza said he built the house for Nzima. He did not mention the capacity in which he built it, but said he would soon make arrangements to have it furnished. “Unfortunately, I could not share the space with him in the house while he was alive,” said Mabuza. Nzima was buried on his farm in the village. He is survived by his wife, seven children, 15 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. - African News Agency (ANA)
