SMC Pneumatics South Africa confirmed yesterday that Alochna Moodley was suspended as soon as the company - based in Midrand - was made aware of the incident. Moodley, 28, was removed from a Kulula.com flight from Joburg to Durban last Friday after a fellow passenger, Reverend Solumuzi Mabuza, saw a text she was sending in which she labelled her fellow passengers and captain k*****s. Moodley was seated between Mabuza and another passenger, Sibusiso Magubane. “I was in the window seat and turned to her side to rest my head so I could take a nap. “I happened to see her text which was in quite large font in which she told the person she was sitting between two k*****s,” Mabuza explained. “She wrote that one of the k*****s kept sniffing, I have chronic sinusitis and (she wrote) the other was reeking of alcohol but (Sibusiso) Magubane said he does not drink. She also referred to the pilot (Captain Menzi) Mvelase. SMC Pneumatics SA  managing director Kevin O’Carroll confirmed that Moodley had been relieved of her post. “At SMC we do not tolerate any form of racism. With regards to the recent events, the employee no longer works for SMC South Africa,” O’Carroll said. Moodley requested more time before making comment on the advice of her lawyer, and because things were still “very heated”. However, she reportedly told The Sowetan that the flight being delayed had led to her frustration. She also asked why another passenger (Mabuza) was looking at her phone, claiming he invaded her privacy.
