The 15-minute show produced by Russia’s state Channel One broke from World Cup tradition, focusing on musical acts including a performance of Tchaikovsky in the capital’s main Luzhniki stadium. Iker Casillas and Russian supermodel and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova brought the World Cup trophy on to the pitch in a Louis Vuitton case. Robbie Williams performed hits Let Me Entertain You and Rock DJ. He was joined in a duet by Garifullina, a soloist from the Vienna State Opera, who entered the pitch on a firebird, singing Williams’ hit Angels. The opening ceremony was followed by a match between the host team and Saudi Arabia. In Pretoria, Russia’s ambassador to South Africa, Mikhail Petrakov, who earlier hosted a celebration of Russia’s national day, invited guests to watch the opening match on a big screen TV while enjoying Russian vodka. Russia won the opening game. See also sport
