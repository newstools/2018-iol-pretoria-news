At the site is the imposing bronze statue of Mahlangu mounted on a large pedestal in the centre of a circular paved area. It is placed at the entrance of Mamelodi West. In recent weeks, locals and tourists who visited the site had been shocked to see the terrible state of the monument. Surrounding fences have been stripped and litter scattered everywhere. Broken glass, decaying fruit and the stench of urine and human faeces hang over the site. The monument is in a state of utter dilapidation, disrepair and degradation. Earlier this year during a Solomon Mahlangu Memorial Lecture, his nephew Gideon Mahlangu lashed out at the DA-led City for not maintaining the monument. “There is a huge difference in the state of the square from when the City was led by the ANC. It is now shabby and dilapidated and doesn’t resemble the stature it should uphold. It’s shameful,” he said. He accused the DA of using Mahlangu’s name to attract tourists and benefit while failing to maintain the monument. “If they can’t respect an icon like Solomon then what about other heroes?” But the City said it had eight staff working from Monday to Friday in and around the square. “It is true there was litter at the facility over the Spring Day weekend given the activities surrounding the welcoming of the new season,” said City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo. He said it should also be noted that the City did not render cleaning services over the weekend. “The fact of the matter is that the facility constantly suffers acts of theft and vandalism of most items of value including fencing, electrical and plumbing infrastructure,” he said. “Since February, 26 cases were reported to the South African Police Service for investigation. We are yet to be informed of an arrest, if any, in this regard.” Mashigo said plans were under way to address the security aspect at the facility; it is only after the security aspects had been dealt with that repairs would be effected to the infrastructure.
