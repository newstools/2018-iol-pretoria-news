Yesterday marked 30 years since one of the worst massacres the country had witnessed - the Strydom Square Massacre. White supremacist Barend Strydom, who called himself the “Wit Wolf”, opened fire on black people, killing eight and injuring 16 on the afternoon of November 15, 1988. The then 17-year-old witness, Bradley Steyn, yesterday revisited the terror site and relived each moment. He cut a sullen face as he explained what occurred. “Bodies lay strewn across the pavements,” he said, pointing around the area which is now the site of the Women’s Living Monument. “It was was just red all over with blood. Almost movie-like. Just being here brings back an ocean of terrorising memories,” he said. It was around 3pm while he was visiting his mother at the State Theatre were she worked. As he walked towards the State Theatre he noticed two terrified women looking at a man holding a 9mm rifle. He thought “Wit Wolf” was perhaps a cop as he was dressed in camouflage. It was at that point that Steyn saw him embark on the shooting spree at pointblank range. Steyn was back at the site yesterday not only to find closure, but to announced that a plaque of the victims’ and survivors’ names was going to be unveiled. “It is the start of a healing project of remembering and commemoration that will lead to the unveiling of a monument next year on November 15,” he said. Steyn, along with uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus, and family members of the victims laid wreaths at the site. Niehaus said that it seemed history had forgotten the victims. The Carrim bothers, whose father was shot that day, also laid a wreath in his memory. They were 21 and 27 at the time, and they told how their father was shot while trying to help a black woman who had been shot inside his shop. “It’s all coming back,” said Feroz, the elder brother. Steyn stills thinks about that day. “I remember the gunshots vividly. They were very loud,” he recalled. See page 6
