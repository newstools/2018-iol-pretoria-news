Mpho Makutu, 20, became the talk of social media after a one-minute video clip of him demonstrating his creation featured on the Facebook page of internationally popular video blogger Nuseir Yassin. Yassin, who goes by the name Nas Daily, had spotted Makutu outside the Soweto tourist spot Sakhumzi Restaurant in December and shot a video. The clip has received over 6million views on Facebook. “I wasn’t aware I was that famous," Makutu said. "I only spent about three hours with him (Yassin) and he promised to get me some support through the internet, but I didn’t think that so many people would be interested in something created by a person like me.” In the video, Yassin said Makutu would have been working for Google had he lived in America. “I met him as I was walking down the street. And I was talking to my friends, how they think this area is so dangerous, and there is not much opportunity. Then I see that guy, and I’m like, wow. There is talent, but there is no ability to showcase the talent. So I had to make that video." Makutu’s work of art, a red robotic crane which weighs 12kg and stands 2-metres tall, is made of components such as drills from old motors, planks, coat hanger wire, cardboard, sheeting of soft drink cans and a roll-on lid. The four motors control the crane’s movements including the jib, which lifts small items and can turn 360º. Makutu made it while studying for an Automotive Repairs and Maintenance qualification at Molapo College. He comes from a poverty-stricken family in Ga-Maja Kopermyn near Polokwane, Limpopo.
