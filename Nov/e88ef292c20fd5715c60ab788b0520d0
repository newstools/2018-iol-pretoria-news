The former owner of the now-defunct The New Age newspaper and ANN7 news channel was supposed to appear later this month, but arrived at the commission insisting that he give his evidence on what happened at the GCIS before he arrived. He was its chief executive in 2011 and 2012. Manyi said he found there was something “horribly wrong” at the GCIS procurement division. He said he agreed with Williams’s testimony that he undertook “dramatic changes” when at GCIS. “It was my duty as the accounting officer to give substance to the PMFA (Public Finance Management Act), because at the end of the day I would be the one accountable. Yes, I did change the bid adjudication committee. I found out that something had gone horribly wrong in procurement. There was an irregular appointment of service providers; one cost government at least R7million. The total project was worth R26m,” he said. Manyi said he discovered collaboration between the bid committee members and those responsible for procurement. “They had a typical way of doing this it was a mini VBS. The situation was untenable There was no way an accounting officer would leave it like that. I told the chief internal auditor to report that to authorities and the auditor-general. Nothing much came out of that.” The service provider was contracted to do work for Statistics SA’s census campaign in 2011. Manyi said it was then agreed with the statistician-general to ask the National Treasury to launch a probe. “I must point out that all this calamity happened in the presence and the participation of the people Miss Williams gave glowing CVs that they were competent and had ticked all the boxes.” African News Agency (ANA) See Page 5
