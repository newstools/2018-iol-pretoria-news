Hundreds of soldiers, friends and families gathered at the Pretoria Military Sport Club in Thaba Tshwane to celebrate Youth Day and watch military service groups compete in drilling. Numerous cars have parked in the Thaba Tshwane streets near the club as not one of the soldiers wanted to miss this annual drilling competitions. A majority of the audience is made up of young soldiers who cheered loudly when the new 2018 recruits from the South African Army, South African Air Force, South African Navy and the South African Military Health Services showcased their drills. Various activities are expected to take place on this day-long gathering. Activities include a parade ceremony, aerobics, cycling, dance, golf, jukskei, a marathon, rugby and soccer. The Defence Headquarters Choir kept the crowd entertained while major generals from the four service groups score the squads based on drilling criteria. The squads will receive prizes for their performances although the South African Air Force would get a hefty penalty for using 2017 recruits.

Chief of the South African Navy and vice-admiral Mosiwa Hlongwane was brought out by the South African National Ceremonial Guard to deliver the keynote address. Speaking in front of the soldiers who lined up to give him a guard of honour, he reminded the youth of the importance of the student uprising in 1976. "Forty two years later, their spirit and dedication to social justice is exemplary. The youth have a role to play in the building of a good nation," he said. Hlongwane said military defence recruits are the youth of the South African Defence Force and had a crucial role to play in protecting the country.
