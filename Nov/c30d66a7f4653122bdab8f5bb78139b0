The latest episode is unfolding just days after the Motswako pioneer was last to rest in his North West ancestral home. It can only be assumed that the family fears that Sengadi, now armed with a court order, will want to exhume the rapper and bury him in Joburg as she originally wanted when she attempted to interdict the funeral. Another side of the coin could be the estate of the rapper, real name Jabulani Tsambo; both the family and Sengadi - whether customary wife or not - should let the man rest in peace. Still on bedroom shenanigans, a woman rushed to the high court to interdict her ex-lover and his new girlfriend from distributing pictures of her naked. It is a mystery why people allow their naked pictures to be in the hands of another person in an era where everything ends up on social media. Look out for the story on the “bedroom master” himself, Home Affairs’ Malusi Gigaba, whose comrades have deserted him after his now infamous sex tape scandal and confirmation that he lied regarding his role in the Fireblade Aviation terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. It appears only a matter of time before President Cyril Ramaphosa pulls the plug and rescues the man from self-inflicted misery.
