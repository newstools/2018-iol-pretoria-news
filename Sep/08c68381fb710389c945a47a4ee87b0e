The Apply Now! Blitz Campaign started in the city on Friday morning at the Marabastad Taxi Rank. On the day, Grade 9 and 12 pupils were given information to help make informed and appropriate career decisions. The department’s Career Development and Open Learning Directorate partnered with the National Student Financial Aid Scheme for the campaign. The aim was to provide those at the rank with crucial information to help them apply to tertiary institutions of their choice. The department’s Celi Khumalo said choosing a career and deciding where to study to obtain a recognised qualification were two of the most important decisions faced by pupils. Khumalo said it was therefore critical they had the right information about the careers they were interested in. She said the career development service was established to provide information, advice and guidance to all South Africans, particularly those in poor and rural communities who had little or no access to information on careers. The campaign will be rolled out across the city, where officials will distribute flyers, booklets and brochures, among other things. It will be at the Bosman taxi rank and train station this Friday, Mabopane Taxi Rank on September 21 and the Mamelodi Taxi Rank on September 28, between 5am and 8am.
