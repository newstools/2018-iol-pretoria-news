The former employees marched from Princess Park to the department to hand in a memorandum in which they blasted the department for failing to implement the recommendations of a report of the public protector which stated that be reinstated. The group represented 90 lecturers, assistant lecturers, support staff and general workers. They said they had been unfairly dismissed by principal Joe Chiloane. They further requested the department abide by the remedial actions recommended by former public protector Thuli Madonsela and incumbent Busi Mkhwebane in the report released in March 2017. Their main demand is to be immediately reinstated. “We can’t even pay school fees for our children or bills for our families because we’re stuck with no job or income. I was dismissed while I was on my workstation. “Imagine being a grown man who is not working, not being able to provide for my family it is disappointing so we want to be reinstated immediately,” said Winners Shitlhavani, who spoke on behalf of the group. He taught plumbing at the college. “We just want a sit down with the department to pave a way forward.” He said the report urged the department to communicate findings of the public protector and the remedial action regarding an investigation into alleged improper conduct, maladministration, abuse of power by Chiloane, tender irregularities and improper appointments of consultants. The investigation also dealt with alleged harassment of whistle-blowers and prejudice suffered. It looked into allegations of procurement irregularities, maladministration, nepotism, corruption and victimisation of employees within the college. The original complaint was lodged on March 10, 2011, with the public protector by an employee of the Pretoria West campus. It was alleged the principal and deputy were harassing staff members who spoke.
