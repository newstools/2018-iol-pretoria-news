JAMES MAHLOKWANE AT LEAST 800 young people queued to register their names for employment and skills development on Friday afternoon at the on-site launch of a R3 billion private sector investment set to act as catalyst for Africa's first Auto City in Rosslyn. Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga proudly welcomed the launch of the Rosslyn Hub expected to eventually become a R50 billion mixed use development. The exciting project was expected to create a lot of employment opportunities and also bring in-demand facilities such as a new hospital and clinic, a university and student residency, also a primary school and secondary school. The crowd not only registered their names to be beneficiaries of the investment but also celebrated the development with a massive braai in the Rosslyn bush that would eventually become a city-within-a-city in the next few decades. Director of Rosslyn Hub, Brendan Falkson, said the development was a crucial step towards the creation of the Tshwane Auto City (TAC). This, he said, was a vision shared by government and the automotive industry to transform the area into the leading automotive investment destination in Africa. David Maake said he was part of the community leaders who mobilised people from Soshanguve to come and register their names and hopefully become beneficiaries. “Anything that will benefit young people and give them a great future is good for our country, democracy and development,” he added.
