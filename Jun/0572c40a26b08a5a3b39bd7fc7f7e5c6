SAKHILE NDLAZI THERE are not many sport-stars who can make their fans freeze with excitement.
But AB de Villiers managed to do just that when he visited an over-enthusiastic supporter at his home in Pretoria east this afternoon. Leon Sadle,14, thought his eyes were playing tricks on him when De Villiers rocked up to his house and sat next to him on the couch It was as if he had seen a ghost in the middle of his dinning room and he completely went numb. Leon described the feeling as inconceivable. “I just went blank. My heart started pacing I couldn’t understand what he was doing at my house. I think I lost my mind for a second there,” said an overexcited Leon. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The instigator of the meeting was Leon’s mother Elsabe, who wrote to Jacaranda FM about Leon being distraught when De Villiers announced his retirement last week. “When I told him AB retired he didn’t believe it and burst into tears,” she said.
Seeing her son in such pain prompted his mom to do damage control. Luckily enough the stars were aligned and De Villiers agreed. But it was a surprise. Leon was told that he was picked to speak on a  documentary about De Villiers, post retirement, as he was overseas at the moment. Right in the middle of the mock interview De Villiers walked in. The pair spoke about the beautiful game in length and even went outside in the backyard where De Villiers gave him a Protea cap and signed his bat. “Leon knows his cricket. Besides being a well informed cricketer, I see in him a genuinely nice human being who is humble. He must keep up with this attitude it he wants to play pro,” said an emotional De Villiers.
