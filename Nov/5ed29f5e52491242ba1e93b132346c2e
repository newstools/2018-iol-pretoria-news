The DA claimed accusations against Baloyi, that she used the province’s EPWP to buy political favour, were behind this week’s protest by disgruntled residents who felt left out. However, Baloyi, who succeeded convicted and expelled ANC councillor Sipho Maselane, said the allegations were devoid of any truth. “They are not telling the truth. The truth is that there were 30 people required for the job for now. All in all there will be 100 people hired,” Baloyi said. Provincial DA spokesperson on access to jobs and education Khume Ramulifho said a lack of transparency in the hiring process of workers angered people resulting in them taking to the streets. “They are accusing the newly-elected, failing, councillor of having compiled a list of individuals she had already selected to be EPWP employees before the by-election even took place,” Ramulifho said. But Baloyi denied that she showed favouritism to her campaign backers, saying workers were part of the community not her people. “I don’t have people. The only people I call my own are my kids and they are at home,” Baloyi said. She said her work entailed playing an oversight role to ensure people from different sections of the ward were considered for jobs. Ramulifho said the appointment of workers was illegal and EPWP jobs were supposed to be allocated to those who desperately needed jobs. He called on Premier David Makhura to intervene in the allegations of corrupt appointments in the EPWP in the area. “During his recent visit to the area, Makhura promised that 2000 Winterveldt residents would benefit from EPWP job opportunities. “However, residents woke up this week to find people in orange uniforms, already appointed and roaming the streets. “These workers had been given contracts until 2021,” he said.
