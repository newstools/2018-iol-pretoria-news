The Downs' gesture comes after the Bulls wore the Brazilians colours as their away kit in Super Rugby this year in recognition of the Downs' CAF Champions League triumph. Springbok and Bulls wing Jamba Ulengo, Bulls co-captain Nic de Jager, scrumhalf Andre Warner, hooker Jaco Visagie, flyhalf Manie Libbok and coach John Mitchell joined Sundowns stars Themba Zwane, Oupa Manyisa and coach Pitso Mosimane at soccer team's headquarters in Chloorkop yesterday. The Bulls players participated in a five-a-side football tournament while Sundowns were training ahead of their highly anticipated PSL opener against Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. The initiative of having Sundowns and Bulls wear each otherâ€™s kit comes from their shared technical sponsor Puma as recognition of the success of both sides in their sporting codes. The Bulls have won three Super Rugby titles and are the second-most successful team in domestic rugby. The Downs have won a record eight PSL titles and are the second South African side to be crowned African champions. - Vata Ngobeni
