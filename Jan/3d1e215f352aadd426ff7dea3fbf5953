Pretoria - DespiteÂ the ANCYL's threat to shut down the University of South Africa, calm has been restored at the Sunnyside campus today. Unlike on Monday where there was no order in the queues, today everything is running smoothly as campus security ensure order is maintained. Current and prospective students said they were pleased to see things running smoothly and getting the assistance they need. Among them was Lindiwe Ngubeni from Brooklyn who came to register. She said she arrived on campus at 5:30am and though she found a number of people already queuing, she was happy she was assisted and leaving the premises by 9am. "The workers assisting us are so quick at processing everything and I am just glad I did not have to be here the whole day," she said.

There are two queues, one for registration and the other for late applications. Though order is maintained, those in the application queue are not as pleased at those in the registration queue. They complain that their queue is not moving and they have been waiting for ages. "They haven't started with our queue yet but maybe that's because we are applying late," said the distressed group of ladies. They said the chances were were high that they would not get assistance as the queue was very long. Justice Mohamed street leading to the campus has been closed and there is police presence nearby. The calmness at the university comes after chaos erupted on Monday as current and prospective students jumped over the university gates to gain access to the premises. This was due to the gates being locked for hours, leaving students restless and jumping over the gates. Pretoria News
