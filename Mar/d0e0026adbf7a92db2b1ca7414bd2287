He was arrested and had claimed R1million in damages from the police. Magic Maila, from Nebo in Limpopo, was thrown into the back of a van and locked up in a cell for two days without being found guilty of a crime. He instituted the claim in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, saying he was arrested for no reason. He denied he had disrupted a meeting the police held with the community to try to calm them down. The police, on the other hand, said he swore and shouted at them and he would not listen to reason. They said they had  been forced to lock him up as he was inciting the community to be even more violent. It was said the police feared that if the community became more violent, they (the police) would have had to resort to gunfire, which would have had dire 
consequences. Police officers testified that on February 16, 2011, they were informed that the community were up in arms after the child’s lifeless body was discovered. The community believed foreigners were responsible and embarked on a house-to-house search for the culprits. The police went to the community to try to negotiate with them, but the road to the Mogaladi Village, where they had gathered, was blocked by about 600 community members who insisted the police had to help them “flush out” all foreigners, because they believed the foreigners were responsible for the murder. A police witness testified that Maila shouted that the police were undermining the traffic police and claimed they had searched his mother’s house for no reason. It was said he used vulgar language and would not calm down. The police said they had no choice but to arrest him for interfering with their work. Maila said he was grabbed by the police for no reason and thrown into the back of a van. He was locked up for two days before being told to go home. Judge Johan Louw found the police were within their rights to arrest Maila, as they could not address the community with him shouting abuse. The claim was turned down.
