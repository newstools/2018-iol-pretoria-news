Her dream came true when she was informed she had been selected to represent South Africa at the event in Florida, USA, in July. “I auditioned for something big without thinking whether I would make it or not because there were thousands of people from every province also auditioning. “Auditions were last August, then one October midnight I received a callback that changed my whole career forever,” she said. The Arts provides the stage to unite the world’s most elite agencies, casting directors, managers and producers with aspiring models, actors, singers and 
dancers. The 23-year-old from Soshanguve will be among a team of aspiring artists from around the world who will arrive in Orlando to perform on stage for those in the industry searching for their next star. She said she had been going through her Facebook feed and saw an agency called Just You Model and Management Agency, which had posted about auditions for The Arts held in Orlando, Florida. “I appreciate the fact that they could see my talent so much, because I have been through so many auditions where I’m told ‘you are so tiny, we wish you were a lot bigger for this role’ and that has somehow discouraged me,” she said. She prepared the monologue of a 23-year-old fierce lawyer, and said the judges were all impressed. Motaung said she had dropped out of college to pursue her acting career, and enrolled herself for a performing arts course at the State Theatre after getting curious every time she passed by. The “12-year-old child in her” that used to write scripts at primary school and act them out came out when she went to see Marikana the Musical. She said after finishing her training, she auditioned so often she wanted to give up, but her breakthrough motivated her. “I always say dynamite comes in small packages. If you don’t test me you won’t know what I’m capable of,” she said. She will be in Florida and New York from July 25 to 29, but needs assistance and sponsorships.
