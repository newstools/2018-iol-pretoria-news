The 100 days countdown to the Africa Aerospace Defence or AAD2018 was launched at the Air Force Base in Waterkloof in June - and now the moment has arrived. The show, scheduled to take place from tomorrow until Sunday at the air force base, is set to wow defence and business people looking to trade and civilians wanting entertainment. Trading will be conducted from the first day until Friday, while the show will be open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Mapisa-Nqakula was part of a panel of sponsors that announced that the exhibition space had already been sold out. This instalment of the 20-year-old bi-annual international show has attracted more foreign delegates and exhibitors than ever before. Leon Dillman, chief executive of leading partner Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa, said organisers were doing final preparations to open the doors tomorrow morning. Mapisa-Nqakula said: “This year the AAD2018 exhibition takes place against the backdrop of our nation celebrating the centenary of the births of (former) president Nelson Mandela and Mama Albertina Sisulu. “The AAD2018 is the largest defence exhibition on the continent and one of its kind, boasting the successful format of a combined exhibition of air, sea and ground technologies. We start with aircraft displays and an air show.” The minister said this exhibition was very important for the economy, but its value was not just monetary. The show could be looked at as an African show and not simply a South African one because it involved neighbouring countries, according to Mapisa-Nqakula. This year’s show is expected to have a surprise finale show that is going to knock the socks off civilians who have already secured their tickets. So far, over 90 official delegations from 47 countries, 100 military and civilian aircraft and 450 accredited local and international media representatives are expected to witness exhibitions from more than 37 countries and over 35000 trade visitors.
