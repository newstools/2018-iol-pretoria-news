He said bogus recruitment agencies targeting the SANDF had been a problem since 2010. The source of the scam was unknown. The SANDF warned the public to ignore and report to the SAPS these fraudulent activities instigated by “faceless charlatans aimed at swindling the unsuspecting and vulnerable youth of their money”. It said the SANDF published application forms once a year in January in national newspapers and on its website. Military recruitment scams have become part of the wider employment landscape in recent years, particularly in the Western Cape, Mpumalanga and North West province. Previously, the operators guaranteed entry to the ranks of the SANDF on payment of amounts from R300 to R1000. One of the biggest scams involved former Private Petrus Ndaba, who allegedly lured around 260 people aged between 18 and 30 from KwaZulu-Natal to Gauteng with the promise of joining the SANDF. The victims allegedly paid up to R800 for registration, a further R1800 for training and another R200 a month after arriving in Gauteng in late 2016, before the scam was revealed in mid-2017 and Ndaba was arrested. Indications were that they underwent at least some military training and took part in a military manoeuvres rehearsal. Ndaba had apparently said they would get positions in the defence force and earn R13000 a month. The men and women shared a three-bedroomed house with one bathroom and used two wendy houses, with males and females sleeping together. Some slept in the kitchen, passages, dining room and lounge. They also had field exercises or full-scale rehearsals of military manoeuvres as “practice for warfare”. After completing their exercises, the recruits said they were forced to do house chores like cleaning, painting walls and even plumbing. The matter is still before the courts.
