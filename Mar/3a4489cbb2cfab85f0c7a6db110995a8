Kamogelo Malemela’s mother Maggy, from Orchards, is pleading with the Basic Education Department to find space for her son. After Malemela bought a house last November, she went around the area asking schools if they could accommodate her son, 18, to repeat his Grade 11. When that proved difficult as schools were closing for year-end, she resumed her frantic search in January - without success. Malemela approached the Gauteng Department of Education’s Odi district office, but officials sent her from pillar to post, refusing to place her son in an English medium school. They allegedly demanded she provide proof that Kamogelo had studied Afrikaans throughout his schooling career. “They asked me to find all his school reports from Grade 1; only then would they be able to convince schools to place him,” she said. On one of their visits to the district offices, Malemela claimed staff ridiculed her and called her irresponsible for looking for space at the last minute. On February 12, she again begged - in vain. Malemela said her biggest fear was for her son. He had posted on his social media profile "it’s times like these you feel like giving up". “I feel my son was judged and his application simply ignored and I feel so helpless as a mother,” she said. Provincial Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said spaces remained a challenge. “We wish to reiterate that we have placed all Grade 1 and 8 pupils.” The department had started interacting with the parent. “We will work tirelessly to resolve it."
