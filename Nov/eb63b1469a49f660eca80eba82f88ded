And to see politicians slugging it out in the only way that they know how and turning the entire situation into politicking adds salt to the gaping wounds of the affected families. At the centre of the politicking is the light that killed five children exactly a year ago. Premier David Makhura, who addressed the first-year commemoration of the tragedy at the weekend, blames the delay in the removal of the light on the City of Tshwane. Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga was not there. But on Friday, he had sent out a communique in which he said the light could not be removed until the SAPS and Department of Labour have concluded an investigation. A day after the incident last November, Msimanga attempted to visit the families, but was sent packing by the residents, who blamed the City of Tshwane for the tragedy. Perhaps the events of that day were still on his mind, but to the grieving families it may be interpreted as him not caring. Makhura, not for the first time, declared that the probe could have long been concluded had it been undertaken by his provincial government. Five innocent lives have been lost; the least Makhura and Msimanga could do is put their differences aside and pressurise both the SAPS and Department of Labour to wrap up the probe. To the souls of the five children, hang there in there little ones; justice will prevail some day. Itâ€™s unfortunate that sometimes it takes longer down here on Earth.
