Being at university isn’t just about having fun and going to parties for a good time but it also serves as an opportunity to learn. It is that vision that saw the Purple Drive Campaign holding its annual breast cancer awareness drive at Sefako Makgatho University in Ga-rankuwa. The organisation started by Siphelele Lunga set up their examination booths, had popular music played by Djs and even the Sefako Makgatho Drum majorettes to entertain students who were anxiously awaiting their turn to get tested for breast cancer. Other organisation members handed out pamphlets with information regarding breast cancer statistics and how to self-examine themselves for those not comfortable with getting tested. Lunga said they wanted to run a campaign on raising important health issues as despite being a health sciences university there were mostly bashes that were organised for students. She said they decided to focus on breast cancer and they offered a service with nurses and in instances where a lump is found they can be referred to George Mukhari Hospital which isright next door to the university. And to ensure students also read the information given to them, Lunga said they were going to have a quiz regarding breast cancer and offer prizes. “It makes me happy that a lot of people have turned up already to take part. Every year we have new students and we want to be able to give them that knowledge.” She added: “We didn’t want to wait until breast cancer awareness month in October because no illness waits for a particular period.”
