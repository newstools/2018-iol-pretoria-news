Among them were academics, students, educators, ambassadors, learners, artists and the public. Themed “Stories Move Us Forward”, the festival promoted co-operation and building a better future for all. In the audience were blind and deaf pupils and senior citizens. The event started with interfaith prayers and a carnival and concluded with storytelling performances at various venues within the Freedom Park precinct. Storyteller Mtumbateka Mamatsharaga wore his traditional attire and carried his dende musical instrument. He said he was taught by his uncle in his youth to tell stories when he accompanied him to herd cattle. “He was creative and made me love storytelling, which is why I want this tradition to move forward to the young ones,” he said. Mamatsharaga grabbed the attention of young people with his Venda stories. He said he used music as part of his storytelling to entice people to listen. Sarah Hlongwane from Bitsanang Old Age Club in Mamelodi said it was her second time at the festival. She said this time the impact of lessons learned made her aware she had to pass on the tradition of storytelling she learned from her mother and grandmother to future generations. More than 11 storytellers, including storytellers from other African states, entertained the audience with stories. Freedom Park chief executive Jane Mufumadi said: “This festival celebrates artistry and showcases the relevance of storytelling today. “Festivals remind us how creativity is powerful in human lives, it moves us beyond ourselves in the same way spirituality does.”
