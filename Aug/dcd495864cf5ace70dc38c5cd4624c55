Mentor said she found her hotel room door’s ledger was broken. A tearful Mentor told commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that she did not want to sound alarmist, but she could not return to a hotel room she did not feel safe in. She said she discovered the door ledger was broken two nights ago and alerted the hotel. When she arrived back from the commission, she found it fixed. On leaving her hotel room yesterday morning, she realised she had left her glasses behind. “I turned back to my room, it is accessible using a card. The door would not open with the card. I then decided to see if it would open without using the card and it did if I had not forgotten my glasses I would have come here having left a room that is unlocked I am worried about going back to a room that I don’t know who accessed it and what might happen,” she said, wiping away tears. Judge Zondo assured Mentor that her safety came first and instructed head of the legal team Paul Pretorius and commission secretary Khotso de Wee to liaise with her and her lawyers to find safer alternative accommodation from last night. “I hear your concerns, and thank you for raising this important issue. Your evidence implicates a lot of people, they may come here and dispute what you said and provide their evidence, but you are concerned about your safety. If it means you have to be moved to alternative accommodation then it must be done. I will check with Pretorius and De Wee this evening and ensure arrangements are made.” Mentor is the third witness at the inquiry. She testified on how former president Jacob Zuma and government officials did the bidding for the fugitive Gupta family who amassed as much as R6billion through questionable contracts at state-owned enterprises. She said Zuma and his son Duduzane gave the Gupta brothers an unfair advantage as they accessed state resources and even picked who became cabinet ministers from their Saxonwold compound. - African News Agency (ANA)
