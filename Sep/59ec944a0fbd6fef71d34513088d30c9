Africa Aerospace Defence (AAD2018) exhibition organisers donated a R20 000 cheque to the Centurion SPCA this morning. The organisers said they made donations to this particular SPCA every two years ahead of the exhibitions as part of giving back to the community. They said the SPCA had to move some of its animals to other shelters for the duration of the internationally anticipated show and these donations would show that they cared for the animals and appreciated the centre. Chief executive of leading partner, the Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa (Caasa), Leon Dillman said the SPCA was close to the air force base where the show took place and it was only fair to donate the R20 000 to it. He said he was aware that the centre needed the money to execute some of its programmes because it was a non-profit organisation that received no funding from government. The SPCA showed AAD2018 crew around its centre for them to see the animals that would benefit from their generous donations. They were happy to see some of the dogs and cats as they handed over the cheque. This yearâ€™s show is expected to have a surprise finale that is going to knock the socks off civilians who already secured their tickets to the show on Sunday. So far, over 90 official delegations from 47 countries, 100 military and civilian aircraft and 450 accredited local and international media are expected to witness the exhibitions from more than 37 countries and over 35 000 trade visitors.
