RUDZANI MATSHILI A media briefing that took place at the ANC headquarters earlier, which unveiled president Jacob Zuma’s fate has left tweeps bewildered. “President Jacob Zuma will be recalled,” ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule announced during the briefing. The NEC believes that this is an urgent matter and should be treated with urgency, said Magashule. Making the announcement this afternoon, Magashule said the party's national executive committee noted that South Africa was going through a period of uncertainty and anxiety. He said that Zuma had requested a notice period of three months but officials had noted anxiety in the country. “The NEC noted the report of the officials that the President had agreed in principle to resign and had proposed time frames extending from three to six months. While appreciating President Zuma’s proposal, the NEC noted that South Africa is going through a period of uncertainty and anxiety as a result of the unresolved matter of transition.” “Further that this uncertainty and anxiety will erode the renewed hope and confidence among South Africans since the 54th National Conference of the ANC,” he said. Now South Africans have taken to Twitter to express their confusion, saying the briefing shouldn’t have happened in the first place as it had left them with many questions.
