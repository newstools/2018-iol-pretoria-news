Glenda Derbyshire from Pretoria is racing, along with her son James, as the only school team in the event, representing St Alban’s College and St Augustine’s. Glenda’s three sons are all old boys of St Alban's College - with James the eldest. According to the “mother and son” team, the school needed drivers for their vehicle Siyakunde and they were keen to take up the challenge because, as a family, they race single-seaters as a hobby. So when the school asked, there were no prizes for guessing who was going to step up to the eight-day challenge. Said James of his mom: “She has really taught me a lot about racing. To be smooth. To never give up. To understand that you might not have your best day the first day but you will get better in time”. Glenda described the first day, on which the challenge kicked off at Times Square Arena, as wonderful, especially as the headmaster, staff, parents and boys were there to see them off. “The sun was on our side, it was good, but by the second day the battery got very low and we struggled. The rest of the time we spent driving to recharge the battery.” she said. The team, known as Sonke, were the only high school to enter the competition. James said: “We are in it to finish it. We are not worried too much about winning, but grooming the next generation,” he said.
