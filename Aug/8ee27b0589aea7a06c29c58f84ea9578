Pretoria - Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga led the DA supporters in song on Helen Joseph Street near the council chamber in Pretoria ahead of the tabling of a motion of no confidence against him. The #HandsOffMsimanga rally was attended by those who expressed their support for Msimanga. The EFF and ANC have vowed to unseat Msimanga through a motion of no confidence, which is expected to be tabled on Thursday afternoon. The two parties collectively have 114 seats - the ANC withÂ  89 seats and EFF with 25 seats. Both parties are confident that they would succeed in their motion to get rid of Msimanga. The numbers by the EFF and ANC would surpass the 50 plus one threshold or 108 of the 214 councilors' votes required to remove the mayor. The DA boasted 93 council seats and the remaining seats were occupied by smaller parties. Msimanga, who was joined by party leader Mmusi Maimane, used the opportunity to defend himself against criticisms levelled against him regarding the latest allegations of tender irregularities. The tender in question was awarded to an engineering company called GladAfrica to assist in the rolling out of infrastructure projects. Msimanga questioned the timing of the motion, saying it was very telling. He said that the DA had acted whenever allegations of corruption and tender irregularities were made. Msimanga was also joined by his members of the mayoral committee, who are likely to be shown the door should the motion succeed. Maimane accused the ANC of wanting to get back the City of Tshwane through the backdoor by voting with the EFF to oust Msimanga. He said the DA was not shaken by the latest political development in the city, saying his party members would remain united against corruption. "The people who voted for change in 2016 (municipal polls) rejected corruption," Maimane said. Pretoria News
