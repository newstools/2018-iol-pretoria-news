The ANC in Tshwane's outright victory of ward 37 in Soshanguve with 62% during the by-election on Wednesday was a testimony that the people have rejected the DA in the municipality, said regional leader Kgoshi Maepa. He took to social media on Thursday to celebrate the win, saying it demonstrated that the people were “tired of the DA”, which bagged 11% of the votes. Maepa said: “The DA brought with it blue lights, food parcels, blankets, election experts from Cape Town, 5000 plus T-shirts, the corrupt DA-led administration in the City of Tshwane and they were flatly rejected by Soshanguve residents. "Our people are tired of the DA.” DA regional leader Abel Tau denied the allegations, saying it was the ANC that brought its political bigwigs, who were driven in blue-lights vehicles. “The allegations against the DA are false. Maepa is the one who brought Premier David Makhura and Transport MEC Ishmael Vadi and the blue-light vehicles,” he said. Tau claimed that there was a businessperson, who was spotted distributing 1 200 ANC T-shirts outside one of the polling stations. “The election process was free and fair, but the environment intimidated people to come out and cast their votes freely,” Tau said. Although the ANC won with the majority votes of 62%, its margin slightly dropped from the 66.73% it registered in 2016. The EFF, on the other hand, increased its margin from 22% two years ago to 26% and the DA grew its support from 8.6% to 11%. The ANC victory meant it would retain its council seat, which was left vacant after the death of its councillor Siphiwe Montlha, who was gunned down in May outside his house. The newly-elected councillor Saki Ntohla would be ushered in council during the next council sitting.
