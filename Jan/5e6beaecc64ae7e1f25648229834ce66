Pretoria - Two Tshwane Metro Police officers were arrested following allegations that they took a motorist to an ATM to withdraw bribe money, said spokesperson of the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) Simon Zwane. Zwane told the Pretoria News that the officers faced charges of kidnapping, robbery, extortion, corruption and defeating the ends of justice at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. Zwane said the accused were arrested on Monday following speedy investigations let by RTMC’s Nation Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the South African Police Service’s Organised Crime Unit, the Tshwane Metro Police Internal Affairs Unit and the Gauteng Traffic Police Compliance Unit. “The motorists complained about the incident and investigations started immediately and on Monday the suspects were arrested when they arrived for duty at their Lyttelton officers. The female officer had just graduated last year,” “This arrest should send a message to everyone that joining the traffic police is not a get rich quick scheme. The police are supposed to be out there protecting the people, not extorting them and eliciting bribes.” Zwane emphasised that corruption within the traffic police was not encouraged and it would not be tolerated. “All police officers must do their work as per the oath they took before taking on the responsibility of becoming policemen and policewomen. The investigations and arrests happened within short period of time to show that no one is above the law.” Zwane said members of the public were encouraged to continue providing the police with tip-off information against any corruption because the RTMC was dedicated to ensuring that those found guilty of wrongdoing were punished. He said members of the public should report traffic related fraud and corruption on 0861 400 800 or email ntacu@rtmc.co.za and all information will be treated confidentially.  james.mahlokwane@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
