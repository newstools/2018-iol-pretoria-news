The arrests were for infractions including drunk driving, hijacking and possession of drugs. Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the department had issued 142573 fines for traffic and by-law offences to date. “Among these arrests, 17 were for drunk driving, 57 for pedestrian source of danger and 19 for possession of drugs, while three were for hijacking and possession of stolen vehicles. “In addition, 10 858 fines were issued for traffic offences such as overloading, using cellphones while driving, disobeying traffic signs, vehicle defects and inconsiderate driving,” said Mahamba. “Speeding remains a major concern. Our officers captured 554 fines with a hand camera during road policing and 132038 speeding fines were captured by the fixed road cameras.” Mahamba said the figures were “very worrying and speak to a lack of discipline and concern for road users”. Acting MMC for Community Safety Sakkie du Plooy praised the police. “While our main focus is to reduce fatal accidents, we are out there doing by-law enforcement and crime prevention.” - African News Agency (ANA)
