Mosola has served Mgobozi with a letter asking him to cite reasons why he should not be fired. Mgobozi, who confirmed receipt of the letter dated November 19 from Mosola, was appointed two years ago. He was asked to furnish reasons why he should not be axed from his position within 10 working days. Mgobozi said he would comply with the request. In August, Mosola released a forensic report into appointments of the City’s senior managers. The report found that Mgobozi lacked at least 12 years' experience, which was part of the requirements for the position. Five of the years was required to be in the senior managerial position. The audit report showed Mgobozi only had two years' experience when he was appointed. At the time Msimanga slammed the report, saying it deviated from the intention to conduct City-wide audit of all qualifications of top level managers. City insiders slammed Mosola for lack of consistency, saying there were hundreds of employees who did not have qualifications and necessary years of experience. “But he isn’t interested in those; his target is the Office of the Executive Mayor,” a source said. Another accused Mosola of sitting on the report regarding the Emergency Services senior official for about a month. “He is deeply implicated as he personally oversaw the recruitment and claimed to have verified his qualifications, together with other Section 56 employees. The South African Qualifications Authority called him out for lying.” He also accused Mosola of failing to take action against a former acting group head of human capital, who was permanently appointed an executive director in the speaker’s office when the job was a fixed five-year term.
