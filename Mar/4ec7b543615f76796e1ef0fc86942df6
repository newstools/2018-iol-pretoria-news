The loved and cherished great-great-grandmother celebrated her 100th birthday at the weekend in style with her family. Her actual birthday was on February 26. Born in 1918, she has seen a lot and worked hard and has no regrets. It was all cheers and songs of joy at the Setabole house in Klipgat when she was wheeled in on a red-carpet by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren on Saturday. The wheelchair-bound gogo, who still speaks, hears and remembers well, was smiling and clapping when the people she brought into this world danced behind her. Setabole has seven children and has a combined 60 grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren. Having worked as a domestic worker for 40 years, Setabole said she also helped raise her employers’ children. She remembers attending the graduation ceremony of a nurse called Ria who she helped raise while she was also raising her own. “I love to watch TV and laugh and eat braaied meat. My children make sure I have everything I need.” She said she did not really have a secret to a long life, but working extremely hard to raise her children as a single mother following the death of her husband, Mishack, kept her going.  He died in 1985. “I grew up in Rosslyn in an area called Makokokong. I came to live this side, initially at Ndlovu and then here in Klipgat in the 1960s. This was after the the apartheid government moved us from our land. “These children of ours will never know how it was like to work as domestic workers back in our days. It was said that school was not  important. I did not go to school. Once you were old enough you went to work in the kitchens and men worked in the gardens. She is still waiting for her RDP house, but she’s not one to complain - she is happy, she said.
