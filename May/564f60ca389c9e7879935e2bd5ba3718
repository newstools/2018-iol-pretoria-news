“I have decided to contribute half my presidential salary to a fund that will be managed by the Nelson Mandela Fund,” Ramaphosa said while tabling the presidency budget speech in Parliament. “This is a private, citizen-driven initiative that will ask all those with the means to contribute a small portion of their salaries to support the many small projects that build the nation.” The Thuma Mina Fund will be launched on July 18, the 100th anniversary of Madiba’s birth. Thuma mina is a Zulu phrase meaning “send me”, and is also a song by the late South African jazz legend Hugh Masekela who Ramaphosa quoted in his very first speech as president. - African News Agency (ANA)
