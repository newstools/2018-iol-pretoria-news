It found Sarah Mothapo and Donald Khoza had conspired with Samuel Kgalakgosi, an officer at Soshanguve police station at the time of the tragedy in 2013. The driver Mothapo was found guilty of culpable homicide and failure to assist the injured child. Khoza was found guilty of defeating the ends of justice by helping to cover up who the driver was of the black Jeep Compass that hit the child. Kgalakgosi was acquitted on charges of defeating the ends of justice. Magistrate Photoge Motiang said even though Mothapo denied she was the driver of the Jeep, four witnesses placed her at the scene that day. There were contradictions in the witnesses' evidence but they were honest and reliable by identifying Mothapo as the driver, he said. “It is clear the driver did not stop. The legislature does not specify what kind of help to render, but the law looks at what kind of assistance to render - calling an ambulance or the police. She failed to do any of those. “It is the driver’s duty to seek assistance, in this case the driver failed to do so. The court proved without reasonable doubt that accused number one (Sarah Mothapo) was the driver of the Jeep.” Mothapo had previously accused the witnesses and co-accused Khoza of conspiring against her, but the magistrate did not find any ulterior motives. Acquitting Kgalakgosi, the magistrate said he was the investigating officer of the initial culpable homicide case, but was not implicated in any wrongdoing. He investigated the matter, took statements and a person was presented as the driver. He couldn't have done more. The dead boy’s father, Goodman Chiloane, was pleased the five year long journey was finally nearing its end. “They are still outside, I was under the impression that the court would withdraw their bail awaiting sentencing.” The matter was postponed to November 28 for a pre-sentencing report.
