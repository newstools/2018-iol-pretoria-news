Soshanguve taxi operators now have a fuel storage facility specially created for them by the Soshanguve Taxi Owners Association (SOTOA). The fuel depot is hard to miss as it stands tall in the heart of Soshanguve Block F, emblazoned with the association's name. It is the first of its kind in the Soshanguve taxi industry and operators could not be any happier about this new project. This is no ordinary fueling station as it is not open to the public and caters only for operators affiliated with the association. Each operator and owner has a token which they load before filling up their taxi's petrol tank. Each time they pour in petrol their receipt or slip indicates to them how much they have left on the token. One of the operators who wished not to be named praised the fueling facility saying it couldn't have come at a better time. He said the fuel lasted way longer than that from other garages. "Petrol from other garages doesn't last as long as this one does and the fact that you can save money on the token is the cherry on top," he said. Chairperson of the association, Mckeed Mogale said this was the first step to a bigger and better taxi industry. He said the fuel storage facility was a pilot project and they aimed to have many more projects where the association will be able to do everything for themselves. The fueling storage facility started operating last year in November and although they faced some challenges, they are now growing from strength to strength.
