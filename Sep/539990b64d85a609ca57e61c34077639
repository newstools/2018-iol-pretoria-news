Drunk driving is increasingly becoming a problem among women drivers in the Gauteng, said Transport MEC Ismail Vadi yesterday. He was addressing a group of girls from Mamelodi during the launch of a campaign called "She Conquers". The campaign was aimed at motivating schoolgirls to stand up against sexual exploitation and gender-based violence, Vadi said. He also encouraged young girls to stay away from doing drugs and taking alcohol. During roadblocks the police have begun to arrest more women for drunk driving than men, he said. "The Gauteng police are finding that in the province more women are now becoming drunk drivers than men. "Drunk driving is becoming a problem for women. It was never there before, but we are picking it up now. "There is alcohol abuse and drug abuse," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Vadi said the idea to have a campaign came about after he held a workshop with about 200 pupils in Mamelodi last year. During the workshop, he said he was touched by a harrowing story related by one of the pupils, who confessed that her mother's boyfriend sexually molested her. "She said that everyday when she walks out of the school gate she asks herself whether she must go home or to her friend's place because she didn't know what was going to happen," Vadi said. One of the pupils during the launch, Loretta Moyo, from Jafta Mahlangu Secondary School said: "I know that as many young women here we face challenges in our lives, but I want to tell you something. "When you are a woman you don't break, you just bend. You never let your background determine your future."
