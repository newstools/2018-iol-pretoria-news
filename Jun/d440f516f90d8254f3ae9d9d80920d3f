Basdeo went missing on June 8, and her 58-year-old husband, Prem Emmanuel Basdeo, was arrested last Thursday after police, the Pink Ladies and others had gone on an intensive search for her. She has still not been found. He faces charges of perjury, and defeating the ends of justice for allegedly not being truthful in his initial statement when he reported his wife as missing. According to police, the murder charge stemmed from forensic evidence; whether or not Basdeo has died would only be confirmed once the investigations had been completed. Prem reported his wife missing at the Brooklyn police station the same evening she vanished, and took part in the search for her, but was arrested. He appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court last Thursday. The case was postponed to tomorrow. According to the police and the Pink Ladies, Basdeo went missing on June 8 after she left home at about 9am to go for a fasting blood test at Lancet in the Life Company of Mary Hospital in Groenkloof. She was driving a silver-grey 2007 Mercedes ML63, which was found abandoned in Soweto two days later. The Pink Ladies organisation is working with the police to find her, and has appealed to the public to share the poster as widely as possible. “Unfortunately she is still missing, but we are appealing to the public to share the poster because it is vital in this situation. "They should share it as much as they can. The more they do so, the more chances of it reaching somebody who might have seen her somewhere,” said founder Desirée Rechner. The Pink Ladies poster has already been shared many times across social media. Some social media users have said Basdeo was found dead. Yesterday the organisation dismissed the rumours of her body being found. “There is no update at this moment. We make announcements when the SAPS have verified the status of the case. Please keep sharing; we appreciate all the assistance from the public."
