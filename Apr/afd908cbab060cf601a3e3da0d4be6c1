The case is around the department’s attempts to mine the land in Xolobeni in the Eastern Cape. Amadiba brought an application to prevent the department from issuing a mining licence to Australian mining conglomerate Transworld Energy and Minerals to mine titanium along the Wild Coast. The committee is made up of residents from the Xolobeni community who have been fighting the proposed open cast mining on their land since the early 2000s. The community is seeking an order preventing the government from granting mining rights over property belonging to the community or, alternatively, that the right not be granted until the land owners have consented. They are also seeking an alternative order that, if the mining rights are granted, the company compensate the community for losses or damages which they are likely to suffer as a result of mining. Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, for Amadiba, argued that if the court granted the department the licence, “they (the community) reasonably fear that mining will result in the physical displacement of community members from their land or homes. Members will also lose access to communal resources they rely on to survive,” he argued. Advocate Vincent Maleka, for the State, said if the community members refuse to consent, the state is allowed under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Act to grant anyone who meets the requirements to mine. He stressed that the act states that minerals belong to the nation and the government is the custodian thereof. The matter continues today. - African News Agency (ANA)
