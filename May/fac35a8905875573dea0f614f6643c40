Mbete said work on the possible relocation would be finalised after next year's general elections. This comes as National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise defended the decision of President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the North West province. Modise said the intervention in North West was not political, but administrative. This followed claims by the DA that the intervention in the North West was due to political infighting in the ANC that had sucked in government. The two presiding officers were delivering their budget votes in their respective houses when the two issues came up. Mbete told the National Assembly a company had been appointed to conduct a six-month socio-economic impact study on the relocation of Parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria. Former president Jacob Zuma had raised the issue two years ago in his State of the Nation Address. In the NCOP, Modise denied DA  claims that the intervention in the North West was politically motivated. DA leader in the NCOP Cathy Labuschagne said the infighting in the ANC had led to the intervention. Modise denied this and said the NCOP was the only institution authorised to intervene. She said a committee would be set up to oversee the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, led by Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Modise said the intervention was not about factional battles in the ANC. She said the government intervened because service delivery had collapsed. The people in the province were beginning to suffer, including in the healthcare services.
