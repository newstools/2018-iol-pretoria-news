The 42nd edition of the annual event saw thousands of people gather at the school with family and friends to enjoy the German beer drinking culture. Ester le Roux said she could not remember how long she had been attending the festival. “This is the kind of festival which does not disappoint; it always has positive vibes, great beer, great music and is a great place to be with friends and meet new people,” she said. Le Roux was with her group of friends who said this year’s edition was even bigger and better than those of previous years. The 42nd Oktoberfest is South Africa’s original fundraising for the school. The festival is known for bringing people together to celebrate true German tradition under African skies. The festival was praised for being family-friendly as it offered play areas for children while the parents enjoyed the beer of their choice. “This is a great place for family because it caters for both young and old. "We are here with our two children, and while we are drinking some beer, they are having their own kind of fun in the playing area,” said Rivonia and her husband Simon Maseko. Oompah music was provided by international cult band Bayern Sturmer from Germany. Other artists included Dewald Wasserfall, Bad Peter, Rubber Duc, The Capitals, Anrico Jeske, Jerry & The Bandits, Josh Kempen & Band, Easy Freak, Martin Black, Werner Bekker, Simone Govender and Sutherland.
