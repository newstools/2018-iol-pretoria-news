Pretoria - Amos Maluleke accused of raping and killing an 8-year-old boy appeared in the Atteridgeville Magistrate's Court on Thursday morning in front of numerous ANC Women's League and #NotInMyName members following his canned bail application last month. Maluleke allegedly used a lollipop to lure the boy to his Atteridgeville home back in April. At the home, he allegedly sexually assaulted him before suffocating him with a pillow. Hlayisani Baloyi's body was found by angry community members who were informed by his peers that he had left with a man who promised him a lollipop. The body was found dumped near a shack in Saulsville not too far from his Atteridgeville home. His neck was twisted and his pants had blood stains. His shoes were also missing. The boy's grandmother, Easter Baloyi, attended court proceedings alongside the boy's mother. The mother was too devastated to speak to the media about the ordeal. Baloyi however told representatives from #NotInMyName that she struggles to sleep since the incident. Members of the community flooded the courtroom in support of the family. They hoped the court could impose a harsh sentence to send a strong message to current and future culprits. The family as well as the community were enraged by the postponement of the case. The community gathered outside the courtroom consoling the family. The matter was postponed to July 10. The state told Pretoria News that investigations were complete and they were ready to start trial. The case could be transferred to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. Pretoria News
