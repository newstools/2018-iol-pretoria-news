The 16-year-old from the University of Pretoria won a silver medal in the 400m individual medley as well as the 200m butterfly. “Having medalled at a senior championship is special, but a lot of hard work still awaits me before I can consider myself to be truly competitive in international swimming,” said Breytenbach. “I need to improve my time in the individual medley by about 10 seconds and in the 200m butterfly by five seconds. The times in my other events are also not good enough yet,” said the Grade 10 pupil at the British Royal College. Earlier this year during the SA Junior Championships he won nine gold medals and three silver medals. Apart from the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley Breytenbach considers the 200m, 800m and 1500m freestyle as well as the 200m breaststroke as events in which he can excel. - African News Agency (ANA)
