The organisation has threatened to mobilise support and march to the SAPS headquarters to express its unhappiness. In addition, Ngcobo’s family also lamented the fact that despite information provided by witnesses, no one had yet been arrested. The 21-year-old, a student at the Tshwane University of Technology, was allegedly kidnapped and his burnt body found inside the boot of the cab he was driving in Sunnyside on March 1. Taxify and Uber drivers blamed metered taxi drivers for his death. Local, provincial and national law enforcement structures vowed to find the culprits and bring the perpetrators to book, but not much has been heard about the case since then. #NotInMyName general secretary Themba Masango said the police interviewed witnesses a while ago. He claimed the information received was not used to advance investigations. He further claimed the witnesses in question had been thrown out of the vehicle Ngcobo was driving at the time of the attack. “What angers us is that we told the investigating officer there are witnesses who saw the whole thing, but nothing has been done and it’s been months now. “If the police do not make an arrest soon, we will bring our members to Pretoria and shut the city down by marching to police headquarters.” Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said: “At this stage we do not have sufficient information that could enable us to take anyone into custody.”
