The Bronkhorstspruit black girl, 9, who was allegedly kidnapped by two white farmers who tied her to a tree before firing a rifle in her direction was still too traumatised to give testimony in court. The state told the Pretoria Magistrate's Court this morning. The state said it was evident that the child was still traumatised by the ordeal after she failed to open up about the alleged incident to a psychologist. This transpired when Johannes Potgieter, 33, and Hendrick Dumas, 48, appeared in court to face charges of attempted murder, intent to do grievous bodily harm, and unlawful pointing of firearm. The court postponed the case to September to allow the prosecution team time to bring in the expertise of a forensic psychologist to help speak to the child. The child's father, Jack Legodi, stood behind the accused on his lonesome and later told the Pretoria News that it hurt him to see Potgieter and Dumas walking freely in and outside court. He said he lived in the same community with the accused in Bronkhostspruit and often came across them. He said each encounter was infuriating but he knew it was important not to take the law into his own hands. Potgieter and Dumas allegedly committed the crime on the basis that the child and some of her friends were trespassing on private property. However, the girl's family explained that the children were following stray dogs. The National Prosecuting Authority transferred the case to Pretoria following a violent protest outside the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court in November last year.
