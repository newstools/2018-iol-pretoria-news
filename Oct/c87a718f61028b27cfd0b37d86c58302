A mini-budget that pleases trade unions and populists would be viewed negatively by Moody’s, warned economist Professor Bonke Dumisa. Dumisa said Moody’s would be monitoring Mboweni’s budget, particularly if it reflected the economic depression South Africa was facing. He said a budget that would make trade unions happy by “dishing out money left and right to everyone” would put the country’s economy at risk. Dumisa said Mboweni should make use of conditional grants that departments had to return to Treasury after failing to spend it to boost the economy. He said Moody’s wanted the government to reduce its budget deficit before it made its pronouncement on South Africa's economic rating. David Maynier of the DA said the party did not expect anything new, but it wanted Mboweni to deal with the question of debt. IFP spokesperson and MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa said Mboweni should cut down on the ballooning public sector wage bill and the perks for ministers and deputies, and “ensure austerity measures are implemented”. Mboweni should suspend the fuel levy until the economy grew favourably and the currency strengthened. He called for a roll-out of an extensive programme of public-private partnerships with favourable investment conditions, including, but not limited to, tax breaks for investment projects. He said Mboweni should also put an end to bailouts and that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) should be handed to public-private partnerships. The government should rescue VBS for the sake of the poor who invested with the bank. Political analyst Protas Madlala said there was nothing much Mboweni could do to address problems facing SOEs until all investigations were able to quantify the damage caused by state capture. He said the government should also start appointing people with skills to run municipalities. “Appointing people without skills is deliberate in order to steal money,” he said.
