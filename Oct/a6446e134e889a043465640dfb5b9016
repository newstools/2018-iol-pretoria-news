Gauteng Department of Community Safety spokesperson Ofentse Morwane said the Gauteng traffic police high speed unit arrested the man at about midday on Friday on the N4 at Bronkhorstspruit as he drove towards Witbank. “He was caught travelling in his BMW and told officers he was rushing to a meeting. “The motorist was arrested on the spot and taken to the Bronkhorstspruit police station where he was formally charged with reckless and negligent driving, as well as an alternative charge of exceeding the general speed limit,” Morwane said. The suspect was expected to appear in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court today. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said: “I am disappointed at the motorist’s driving behaviour and conduct, especially that it happens when we are observing Transport Month.” African News Agency (ANA)
