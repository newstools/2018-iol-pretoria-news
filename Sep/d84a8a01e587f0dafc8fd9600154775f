Pretoria - With thieves targeting frail and elderly citizens' grant money every month north of Tshwane, the Ga-Rankuwa SAPS and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) are helping them detect counterfeit money better. The Ga-Rankuwa SAPS in partnership with the SARB embarked on an awareness campaign to address the high rate of criminality taking place. In Zone 16, SAPS members and a SARB team demonstrated to the elderly how to check which features to look out for in order to detect the authenticity of their notes. SAPS north spokesperson, Matthews Nkoadi, said the idea to create awareness amongst the elderly citizens came to members following a noted prevalence of cases of counterfeit money that were regularly being opened every end of the month. Nkoadi said in most of the cases the majority of the victims were the unsuspecting elderly north of the city. “You would find regular reports of an elderly citizen withdrawing their grant money at a pay point, only to be turned back at shops after they detect the money is fake.” “We’ve even had taxi drivers and spaza shop owners coming forward to report that they were receiving a lot of fake money from pensioners every month end.” He said the elderly present expressed gratitude for the knowledge and as such the team would conduct further awareness campaigns in areas reporting increased cases.
