They said they had hoped the court would decide on the fate of Thabiso Mkhonto, who pleaded guilty to stabbing Mpho Chuma, 24, more than 24 times in January. Mkhonto, 26, admitted to the attempted murder charges in April, and the prosecutor and his team started compiling paper work for sentencing. Six weeks on, the court learnt there were some aspects of the report that were missing and postponed the matter to Wednesday. However, family members were not impressed and felt that the court was dragging its feet. After speaking to the investigating officer, Chuma’s mother, Magdalene “Maggie” Raseala sang a different tune and said she was confident that the matter would next week be put to rest. When Mkhonto pleaded guilty, his lawyer, Carmalita Smith, read a statement explaining what had triggered the stabbing. Mkhonto said at the time, the two were still lovers. He said on the day of the incident, he had asked Chuma for her cellphone which she gave to him; he then went through her messages and found chats between Chuma and her friend stating that she was pregnant. Out of anger he confronted her about the messages, to which Chuma admitted she cheated on him with her 
boss in order to get a 
promotion. “When I saw the messages it did not sit well with me. I became very angry because we had promised to be loyal to each other. “It was then that I stabbed her several times with a knife on her body.”
