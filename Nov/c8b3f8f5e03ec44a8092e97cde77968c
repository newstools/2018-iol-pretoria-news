Ma Sisulu, as she was affectionately known, was an important female leaders of anti-apartheid resistance and this year marks the centenary of her birth. The campaign, launched at the Union Buildings, is designed as an ongoing effort to drive the conversation of how women can continue Sisulu’s legacy. As part of the event, the first 100 Women of Fortitude were announced. The women have been selected with the participation of the Sisulu family, based on the work they are doing in their respective fields. Charmaine Houvet, the policy director Africa for Cisco and an ambassador of Women of Fortitude, said the women would serve as mentors during the campaign and spread the message of citizenship, encouraging other women to get involved in the spirit of Sisulu. The tagline, “find the Ma Sisulu in you”, aims to bring to life the active citizenry of Ma Sisulu and remind each of us that she did not do it alone; she did it as a collective effort to strive to make a meaningful change in people’s lives, she said. The campaign ties in with Global Citizen on December 2, as well as the upcoming 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, all of which urge awareness of the challenges and broad participation in finding solutions to the problems in our society. How can one get involved? “Create change by connecting with one of the Women of Fortitude if you are interested in their project or have your own idea and want mentorship.” And what about men? The campaign needs their support as it is a collaborative effort. To find out more, follow #WomenOfFortitude. - Editor, Val Boje
