More than 32 million votes last night gave South Africa a new music idol and an instant millionaire in Yanga Sobetwa, 17, who was announced the winner at the packed Carnival City’s Top Arena. After weeks of seeing a hopeful exit to Mzansi’s favourite music competition every Sunday, it has been an incredible, soulful and entertaining journey for the Idols contestants. Cape Town-born Sobetwa walked away - rather drove away - with a new Ford Fiesta Titanium and R1million in cash. The winner will also record a new album in the coming few weeks. The Big Top Arena was star-studded with big South African artists that kept everyone on their feet. There were performances by Kwetsa, Mlindo The Vocalist, Black Coffee, AKA, DJ Tira and the Idols Season 13 winner Paxton Fielies, who performed her hit single Angifuni that got everybody singing along. It was a night that wasn’t short of bling, fire and sauces, literally with so many performances to remember. The top two performed their Show Stopper themed songs to take the audience down a short memory lane. From here, those who have the vocals, the resilience and are not older than 30, the Season 15 audi- tions will kick off on January 26 at the South African State Theatre in Tshwane.
