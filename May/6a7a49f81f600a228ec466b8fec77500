The party’s Sipho Tshabane, who led a mobilisation campaign at Church Square yesterday ahead of the mass protest, said the programme was expected to start at noon. Tshabane said they wanted to send a clear message that they were in solidarity with Western Sahara over the illegal colonial occupation of land by Morocco. “The reason to go there is the issue of Morocco and Western Sahara, the issue of land. So, as the EFF, we are going to give them our view," Tshabane said. “We really want people to support the issue of land. We won’t allow land to be taken in another country or anywhere for people to be oppressed when we are watching. We are here to shake things up.” Tshabane said a lot of people showed interest in joining the picket when they mobilised at Church Square, where people will gather ahead of the picket today. “There are too many people who came here. More than 10 000 people are expected. We are going to picket and send a message to all African countries to say we are in solidarity with Western Sahara,” he said. Tshabane could not reveal who would be leading the picket, but both national and provincial leaders would be present, he said. “We have the leadership of the EFF from national but I can’t disclose the names, and we also have provincial, but the keynote speaker is from the national." Supporters will start to gather at about 10am, with buses picking them up at Church Square, he said.
