Sylvester was moved in 2016 to a game park, Kuzuko Lodge, in the Addo Elephant National Park, after breakouts from the Karoo National Park. In the first escape, the lion was on the run for more than three weeks, walking more than 370km outside of the Karoo National Park. He was fitted with a satellite collar, but escaped again. During the second, three-day escape, wildlife officials dropped plans to kill him after an outcry. Angel and her two little cubs started moving around together last week, Kuzuko Lodge said. The cubs are about 12 weeks old and in good health. The courtship happened during the first week of March. Sylvester has been at Kuzuko for more than two years and has a tight-knit coalition with his male counterpart, Fielies. Sylvester, and his lioness, Angel, have defied all odds to become 100% integrated lions in the wild,” said the lodge. Kuzuko Lodge reserve general manager Gerhard de Lange said: “Our two lionesses were on contraception, but we started to suspect Angel had given birth. She showed all the signs of having cubs suckling her, but lionesses keep their babies ‘hidden’.” . Mercury Correspondent and African News Agency (ANA)
