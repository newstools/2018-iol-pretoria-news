The pupils had visited the SAPS Academy in Pretoria West as part of the Cell C Take A Girl Child To Work campaign and got to see what a day in the life of a police officer looks like. They visited exhibitions to see a variety of demonstrations from the Special Task Force, the Air Wing, K-9 and Public Order Policing units. Boipelo Leburi, 17, from Modiri High School in Ga-Rankuwa, said it was fascinating to visit the stalls and learn about the career paths the service offered. “I didn’t know the SAPS had interesting careers, it’s not that stomach-in, chest-out thing only.” Boipelo said. “The amount of work that goes into their work is amazing, so I’m glad I got educated about the ­organisation.” Sergeant Ian de Koker of the search and rescue team was overwhelmed by the attention his German Shepherd received from the learners. He kept saying: “Come closer; it doesn’t bite”. “The average dogs you see when driving around are patrol, narcotics and explosives dogs. Then we have specialised dogs, which are for search and rescue, biological fluid detection, currency and endangered-species dogs, which are trained to detect abalone or currencies,” he said. De Koker said his job was extremely interesting, every day was different, and a love for dogs made it much more interesting. The kids were addressed by senior police management, including Lieutenant-General Bonang Mg­wenya, representing national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole. She used the opportunity to high­light violence against children, saying: “Despite the protection enshrined in our constitution, children remain vulnerable to criminality.” She urged them to refrain from walking alone, going out without letting their guardians know, or going somewhere without telling anyone.
