The UP-Tuks engineering students readily admit to being mesmerised every time they watch their heroes ceaselessly fight their way out of any scenario with sword in hand. To top it all, they make it seem like fun. While engaged in duels to the death the movie heroes always seem to find the time to make a witty chirp or two. The final clincher for the duo was when they saw an article in Perdeby (the official student newspaper of the University of Pretoria) encouraging students to take up the sport. The net result is that Moosa and Odegoke are representing UP-Tuks this week at the University Sports South Africa Tournament at Wits. “When reading about history, it seems as if sword-fighting played an integral part in the outcome (of events), especially during the earlier, prophetic times,” said Moosa. “Fencing is the activity that allows me to be closest to the practise of sword-fighting, as it was done throughout the history of Islam, which is my religion. I played tennis and did a bit of archery before taking up fencing. “What excites me is that archery and fencing allow for a sense of concentration not offered with other sports. I feel that fencing does not only train me physically. “Mentally, it helps to increase my focus and to control my ‘anger’, as well as helping to improve my reflexes every time I try to score points during a bout.” Odegoke likes the pace at which things tend to happen during fencing. “Everything is fast. Not only do you have to be quick on your feet, but you have to be focused all the time. “That lapse in concentration for a moment can easily turn out to be costly. I have found that in fencing you have to be able to make decisions in mere seconds. “It boils down to trying to decide what move you are going to make while at the same time trying to work out how to counter.” African News Agency (ANA)
