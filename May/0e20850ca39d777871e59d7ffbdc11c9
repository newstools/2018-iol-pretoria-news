“Some 14 million South Africans go hungry every day and another 14million are on the brink of
hunger, and it’s not right,” said Food Lover’s Market’s Andrew Milson. Milson and the Food Lover’s team said the store was on a mission to eradicate food insecurity this World Hunger Month. The store has joined forces with brands such as TruCape, Simpl. Juice and Rungani to donate 79c of every juice, carrot, pear or apple pack sold by these retailers to Food Forward SA. They will also donate 1% of their turnover on World Hunger Day, May 28, to the NPO to feed the hungry. The Food Forward organisation collects surplus food from retailers and farms which is stored at their warehouse and distributed to NPOs who feed the hungry. Through its network and food bank, Food Forward is able to provide a meal at a cost of 79c a serving by distributing food it obtains for free, allowing thousands of people to be fed daily. Food Lover’s Market hopes to get everyone on board by encouraging shoppers to buy selected produce. “Kids go to school and study seven subjects, all without having had a hot meal in the day. “Also think about pregnant women who don’t get the nourishment they need. We need to take steps to eradicate hunger in South Africa - everyone can contribute to eradicate hunger,” said Milson. Fruit Forward chief executive Andy du Plessis said children aged 6 and younger were especially
vulnerable and often didn’t receive the nutrition they needed to learn and grow. “About 25% of children in SA are stunted because they didn’t get the proper nutrition. We partner with major wholesalers and retailers and say instead of dumping surplus food, give it to us for free. It’s food that’s well within date. “We want to make sure we address food insecurity in a dignified manner. We assist 600 NPOs nationally and they provide a meal four days a week to 250000 people,” said Du Plessis.
