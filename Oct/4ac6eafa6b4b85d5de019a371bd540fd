The show is on Saturday and Sunday from 4pm at Sun Arena, Time Square. Doors open an hour before the show starts, and ticket prices for the show range from R198 to R498. It will feature performers from all over the country, including the South African Army Band from Kroonstad, Western Cape Army Band, pipers and South African Highland dancers, as well as international acts. Andy Dippenaar, narrator of the SA Tattoo, said their last performance was in 2013, and they decided to bring back the show, this time to Pretoria, due to popular demand. Dippenaar said the concept of Tattoos dated back to military times during the 1800s when soldiers would be called back to the barracks by drummers signalling "close the beer taps.". But over the years, he said, Tattoos had been turned into displays of military music, ceremony and pageantry. Dippenaar said Tattoo performances had become a global phenomenon with shows in America, Australia and the Far East. “It’s a wonderful entertainment spectacle, a combination of sheer joy and entertainment with this sort of military precision and ceremonial part of it, which is an interesting juxtaposition. “It’s not a regular musical act, but there are performers of all ages and backgrounds coming together to create acts that can be enjoyed by persons of all ages, young and old.” The groups started off their first practice session at the Glen High School at the weekend ahead of their two-day performance this weekend at the Sun Arena. The show will feature 10 bands from around the country, consisting of more than 250 pipers and drummers. The South African Highland Dancers will be joined by the OzScot Highland Dancers from Australia as well as dancers from Basel in Switzerland. Other acts include traditional tribal dance groups, the Tshwane Military Choir and the Infantry Division Silent Drill Squad.
