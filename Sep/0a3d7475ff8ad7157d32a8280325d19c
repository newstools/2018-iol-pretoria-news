In the meantime, students have been given until today to move out of the residences. “For their own safety, all students are encouraged to vacate residences at these campuses while activities are suspended,” the university said. The suspension of academic activities has entered its third week, and a court interdict didn’t seem to douse the anger of students as vandalism continued. Some students from as far as KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo complained that they had no money to go back home, especially at this time of the month. Some said they would be squatting with friends, while some had no idea where they would be heading. Protests erupted last month after the death of student Katlego Monareng, allegedly at the hands of police, and have continued since. The university has also issued suspension letters to students allegedly involved in the protests. The students had been identified as perpetrators of the ongoing protest action and damage to TUT property. Management made the decision on Monday following ongoing disruptions at both the North and South campuses. “Due to the volatility of the situation and the risk to the safety of staff and students, the university had no choice but to come to this decision, which aims to normalise the situation at the institution,” TUT said. The university said it would increase security “to ensure the safety of the campus community once activities resume”. Monareng was allegedly shot by a police officer following a protest against the perceived rigged SRC election at the Soshanguve North campus last month. Despite the delay in resuming academic activities, the university has said that year-end exams would start as scheduled on November 12. Spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said the university would continue to engage with student leaders. “We heard their demands and made decisions as far as they are concerned. We provided feedback and yet this doesn’t come to rest. We are investigating,” said De Ruyter.
