MINISTER of Transport, Blade Nzimande assured motorists that they will receive their licences despite the impasse between the Department of Transport and the Driving Licensing Card and Account (DLCA) employees. He said DLCA is currently undergoing its yearly routine maintenance of its machinery and systems. Therefore, contingency plans have been put in place to recover the turnaround time and deliver the cards as per prevailing standards. The statement comes after the DLCA production team declared that motorists awaiting driver's licences will not receive them until they were given permanent positions as promised. Employees said they had been working for the company since 1998 and had no problem with their bonuses and benefits. However, tables turned when they were transferred to the Department of Transport three years ago. The group said although they were transferred to the department according to the Labour Act 197, they were still contract workers with the uncertainty that they will ever be given permanent positions as promised. Today marks the fourth working day since the group was shown the door after they refused to renew their contracts. They continued to camp outside the gates of the Erasmuskloof base as their access cards have been taken away. The group said there was no way they were going to sign the new contract as they did not agree with its conditions. They said: “The new contracts state that we were not transferred according to the Act, meaning that if we sign we will forfeit all benefits of the years worked at the company.” The production team said they were responsible for the manufacturing, capturing and issuing of licences to all driving departments in the country and since they had downed their tools, no one was to get their licences.
