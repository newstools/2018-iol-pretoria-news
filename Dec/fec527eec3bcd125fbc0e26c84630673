Throughout the year, unions and employees have been at loggerheads with the department regarding the safety and health hazards in the building. After floor-to-floor inspections were conducted, inspectors stated that 29 floors in the building were non-compliant with the Occupational Health and Safety Act. On December 21, boxes and furniture could be seen outside the Civitas in what was erroneously reported as the department vacating the building. However, departmental spokesperson Popo Maja said they were not moving out of the building; it was in fact the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority that was relocating. The authority finally got separated from the department, starting off with the relocation from the Civitas, and would be based at the CSIR in Brummeria, Pretoria. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi indicated that it would act as the replacement of the Medicines Control Council, and be responsible for monitoring, evaluation, regulation, investigation, inspection, registration and control of medicines, scheduled substances, clinical trials, medical devices and related matters. Maja said major renovations to the Civitas building were being undertaken, specifically waterproofing of the concrete roof in the North Tower of the building. He added that deep fumigation had been carried out this week. Pretoria News
