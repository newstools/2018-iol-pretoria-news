NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw yesterday said that after careful consideration of representations submitted by Dramat's legal team to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it was decided not to continue pursuing criminal charges against him. “The NPA is of the view that his version, as contained in his representations, is reasonably and possibly true,” Louw said. The trial of Gauteng Hawks head Major-General Shadrack Sibiya and former police investigator Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Maluleke will meanwhile start in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, on October 8. They were due to appear in court this week, together with Dramat, but Louw said the matter would now only proceed next month. The pair are facing several charges, including seven of kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and contravening the Immigration Act, following the rendition of several Zimbabweans in 2010, wanted for the alleged murder of a top policeman in their country. Sibiya, Dramat and Maluleke appeared several times in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court before their case was transferred to the high court. They are out on R5000 bail each.
