Sport in the City has been given a much needed boost with the Tshwane Sporting Council finally given a place to call home. Early today sporting council regional representatives gathered at the Es’kia Mphahlele Library in Sammy Marks Square to be officially welcomed to their new offices. The offices, as well as a much needed R500 000 cash injection were handed over by the City of Tshwane’s Department of Community and Social Development Services. Sporting Council vice president, Johan Welmans, said he was happy that the council which has existed since 2012 could finally start working and contributing positively to sporting efforts in the city. Welmans said moving forward they could at last be the real and functional custodians of sports representing the seven regions, two universities, five sports NGOs and 47 sporting codes in the City. And with this move he said they would be making promises they hope to achieve for sports in the city. Some of those promises being: “We will support all sport initiatives of the city, deal with transformation issues with sports federations, source funding and build relationships with all sports federations.” Member of mayoral committee for Social Development Services, Ntsiki Mokhotho, said the council played a key role in identifying, nurturing and developing the extensive challenge in our city through numerous projects. Mokhotho said the work of the council was more important than ever in the fulfilment of the vision of the national sports and recreation plan. “Sports councils are at the very heart of integrated development of sports at all levels. Their responsibility is that of co-ordinating programmes through local clubs.”
