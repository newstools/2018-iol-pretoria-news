MMC for Utility Services Darryl Moss said the sewer spill reported by residents two weeks ago came after the contractor damaged a sewerage pipe, causing blockages in the process. The situation exposed residents to faeces-infected water, which overflowed from manholes on the corner of Frikkie de Beer and Tak streets. Moss said the problem was discovered during a recent on-site inspection by the City. On Friday, the City made another site visit with the contractor in order to finalise the repairs. Last week, residents expressed worries that grey water was allowed to flow into the river, and complained about the foul stench. MMC for Agriculture and Environmental Management Mike Mkhari vowed to have the mess cleaned up. The Moreleta Spruit flows right through the Moreleta and Faerie Glen nature reserves in the east of the city..
