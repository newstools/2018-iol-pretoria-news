While executive mayor Solly Msimanga was evasive, he too hinted that the relentless damage to electricity substations, contamination at water plants and land invasion were the work of a third force. Msimanga said the saboteurs not only vandalised electricity infrastructure, but also shoved dead calves, logs, bricks and cement bags into the sewer systems. “You have a reservoir being closed in a particular area and the valve of that reservoir chopped off, and when you send people to go fix that, there are so-called community leaders preventing your workers from repairing that.” Asked if the derailing tactics were politically-motivated, Msimanga said: “I cannot say definitively. But it must be known that some interruptions to our infrastructure are sometimes as a result of human intervention. “Classic examples are to our water infrastructure where we find bags of cement and carcasses of animals in the system that ordinarily would not be there were it not for a human hand. "And we all know who lost power and is desperately trying to regain it, right?” Last week, Msimanga posted pictures of vandalised infrastructure on Facebook captioned: “This can’t be about cable theft alone; it’s sheer vandalisation of our infrastructure City manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola said they had reason to believe that the saboteurs knew which part of the infrastructure to target for maximum impact. It is very worrying that these guys are in the middle of nowhere and actually know that there are cables. “This indicates that the criminals have our infrastructure plans,” he said. Utility services MMC Darryl Moss said metro police would patrol the areas regarded as hot spots. “At the same time we have strengthened its anti-cable theft unit and are launching a tender for security systems including armed response, beams and alarms, cameras, vibration sensors and other interventions.”
