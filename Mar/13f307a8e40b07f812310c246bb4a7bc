The event took place at the intersection of Casper Avenue and Eloff Street in Eloffsdal in the west of the city. While the fires burned and the smell 
of meat wafted through the air, guests could tune into Jacaranda's drive show with presenter Rian van Heerden doing a live broadcast. Van Heerden said street braais were part of our South African culture and the idea of the #Straatbraai was to bring people together, to get to know their neighbours and “create a sense of common cause and unity”. The #Straatbraai will be visiting a series of locations in the coming weeks. - Staff Reporter
