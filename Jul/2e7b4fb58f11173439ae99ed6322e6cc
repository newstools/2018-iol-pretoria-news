Church groups led by Bishop Bheki Ngcobo of the National Interfaith Council of SA and associate Bishop Vusi Dube will lead the pack in an all-night vigil planned for tomorrow night. A campaign calling itself #Wenzeni_uZuma plans to mobilise Zuma’s followers ahead of his next court appearance. A motorcade and night vigil tomorrow will be followed by a walk to Dales Park in Pieter- maritzburg and culminate in a march to the city court on Friday morning. Outside court, the church groups Delangokubona Business Forum, the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (NafupaSA), uMkhonto weSizwe veterans, Radical Economic Transformation champions, Black First Land First and other groups are expected to gather in numbers from early in the morning until after Zuma’s appearance, due to start at 9am. The charges against Zuma relate to 783 payments, which, it is claimed, he received in connection with the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal. The National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges in 2009 just before Zuma was sworn in for his first term as the country’s president. Proud supporter of Zuma and uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus said that events in support of the former president have been planned for 24 hours before he is due to appear. “It will all be very similar to the support shown in the previous court appearances. “We will have a night vigil in Pietermaritzburg and a march and a rally outside court. Expect the big numbers as usual,” Niehaus said. He said the night vigil will focus on prayer, entertainment from musicians and speeches by supporters of the former president.
