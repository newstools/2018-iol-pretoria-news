The Post Office said it had transferred 1million social grant beneficiaries from the outgoing CPS Sassa card to the new card issued by Postbank. Chief operations officer Lindiwe Kwele said the first million beneficiaries did not include those who willingly opted to take up Postbank Mzansi accounts as their preferred payment method. According to the service provider, grant beneficiaries with the old white Sassa card, which is to be phased out by September 30, were being advised to  take the new gold Sassa card. Post Office (staff) were deployed throughout the country where dedicated temporary card swop sites were established in local council halls. The goal is to put as many people as possible on the new cards before the end of August. Kwele said issuing a new card took a few minutes. “The new gold Sassa card guarantees that you will not be debited with a monthly service fee of R10, or more, or illegal deductions for loans, airtime or electricity.” Elsa Minnie, 74, a Sassa beneficiary, had been frustrated trying to get a new card: “I went to the Post Office twice in different areas and they told me to come to Sassa offices.” Post Office spokesperson Johan Kruger said they were aware of some delays at some branches. “We had to purchase fingerprint readers and point pads, but now everything is on board. “Beneficiaries in areas such as Soshanguve, Mamelodi and Mabopane can go to the mobile points that will be set up over weekends to make the transition easier for them.”
