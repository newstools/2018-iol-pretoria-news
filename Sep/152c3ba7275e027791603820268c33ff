There was delight on the faces of the girls who swopped their soccer kit for swimming costumes at the Tuks LC de Villiers indoor sports centre at the weekend. Their lessons are being provided by the Kiddies Aqua Swimming Academy under the auspices of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation. Arrie Botha, of the academy, said many local soccer teams had not had the opportunity to learn to swim and Safa had approached them for help. He said that often, when the girls travel, they stay in hotels with swimming pools or close to the beach, so the academy understood the need for them to enjoy these facilities. “The project is in its second year and what we have experienced is something phenomenal. "The girls come to us every Saturday morning for swimming lessons and we are proud that they now know all about water safety and can enjoy water more." The girls collected their medals last weekend. Manaki Makhoana, 16, from North West, said: “I never thought I would know how to swim in my life. The instructors were patient with us and now I am very proud that I know how to swim."
