The increase is part of a combination of tax proposals for the 2018 Budget that is expected to generate an additional R36billion in tax revenue for the 2018/19 financial year as government has reviewed 
its revenue shortfall of R50.8bn. The increases on alcohol and tobacco products - also known as “sin tax” - will bring in more than R1.3billion in revenue, says the Treasury. Gigaba announced that drinkers of alcohol products will pay 
between 6% and 10% more for their habit. Smokers will have to cough up 8.5% more for tobacco products. “The main tax proposals for the 2018 Budget are a 52 cents per litre increase in the levies on fuel, made up of a 22 cents per litre for the general fuel levy and a 30 cents per litre increase in the Road Accident Fund Levy, and an increase in the alcohol and tobacco excise duties of between six and 10 percent,” Gigaba said in his speech in Parliament. The new Budget announcement means that an excise duty of 15 cents will be charged on every 340ml can of malt beer. Currently consumers pay R86.39 a litre, but with a nominal 10% increase, this will go up to R95.03 a litre. A similar tax will apply to ciders and alcoholic fruit beverages. Duties on traditional African beer remain unchanged at 7.82c per litre. Wine lovers will see a 23c per litre increase on unfortified wines and 28c increase for fortified wines. Excise duty for sparkling wine will go up by 73c. National Treasury proposes an increase of R4.80 per 750ml bottle of spirit products meaning spirits will increase to R190.08 per litre of absolute alcohol, up from R175.19 currently. A charge of R1.22 will be imposed on a box of 20 cigarettes. The current excise duty on a box of 20 cigarettes is R14.30. It will increase to R15.52. Cigarette tobacco products will be hit by an increase of R1.32 per 50g. A R6.45 excise duty will be charged on cigar products while pipe tobacco will see a R1.37 increase. Also expect to pay more for cars, cellphones and other luxury goods which attract ad valorem excise duty, which is a tax levied on commodities as a percentage of their value. The ad valorem excise duty on motor vehicles will increase from 25% to 30% from April 1. Chief economist for the Efficient Group Dawie Roodt said he did not see the positive outcome from sin taxes “because it doesn’t even contribute that much to the fiscus”. “I think sin tax along with sugar tax is, for lack of a better word, stupid. People don’t want a politician telling them what they can smoke and drink,” he said.
