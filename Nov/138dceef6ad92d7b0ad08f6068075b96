The Basotho delegation is in South Africa for four days, and SANDF adjutant-general, Major-General Eric Mnisi, said it was a step forward in forging relations and harmonising the military legal systems of both SADC countries. The aim of the visit is to create co-operation between the two countries at a strategic level. Also, for the Lesotho legal section to benchmark, share ideas and exchange expertise with the SANDF legal services division. The Lesotho delegation will, in its time here, visit military courts where it will observe a trial. It will also visit various directorates in the defence legal services division of South Africa, where the delegation will be given presentations. The first day kicked off with the theoretical part of the visit. SANDF representatives gave presentations of how military legal systems operated in the country. Acting adjutant-general Zinasele Kani, standing in for Mnisi, said with Lesotho being completely surrounded by South Africa, they had invited them to share experiences in how the SANDF conducted matters with regards to military justice and support. Kani said, with issues arising from the Lesotho defence force over the years, they were of the opinion they could learn a thing or two from the SANDF and bolster the countries policy of facilitating good relations. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabang Mathajane, from Lesotho, said over the years that country experienced challenges in terms of instability, with the military also being involved in the upheavals. “For us, this tour is about acquiring as much knowledge as we can, because we are currently in the process of reforming our justice system and we hope to learn a lot about what is done here to incorporate into our systems. Our chief of the defence force has prioritised this visit as it may help us in our bid to overhaul our justice system as it is the cornerstone of any administration. “If that one is solid, hopefully everything else will fall into place,” he said.
