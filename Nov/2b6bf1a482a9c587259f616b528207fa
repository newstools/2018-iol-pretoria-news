Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga on Wednesday led an anti-crime raid in Marabastad, where he had tough words with business people breaking municipal bylaws. He warned some shopkeepers that they risked having their businesses closed if they continued to flout bylaws prohibiting them from selling stock on the pavement. He said shopkeepers selling goods on the pavement, instead of selling them inside their shops, contravened the terms and conditions of their business operating licences. During the raid Msimanga confronted those who were caught on the wrong side of the law and ordered them to remove their stock from the pavements.

"Where should people walk while you have your stock on the pavement? "If I come back here tomorrow and find these things here we will close you down and take everything else," said Msimanga. One of the business people reasoned that he was not the only one guilty of the offence, saying the practice was common in the precinct.

"What you are saying is that if there is someone, who is throwing himself in the fire it means you are also going to throw yourself in the fire." He also expressed a concern that Marabastad was increasingly becoming a lawless precinct. The anti-crime operation was in line with the City's initiative called Operation Tswelopele, aimed at cleaning up the municipality of illicit activities.
