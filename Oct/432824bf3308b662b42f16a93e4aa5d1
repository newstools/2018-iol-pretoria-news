The event is being held to celebrate the centenary of Nelson Mandela and Jerusalem, or Al-Quds, following the city’s designation as the permanent capital of Arab Culture. The event is being co-hosted by the League of Arab States and the South African government. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa attended the official opening, which included a reception at the State Theatre and performances from musicians and dancers from Sudan, Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Palestine, to name only a few of the Arab countries represented. The five-day event ends today with a fashion show, dance performance and food festival at the Ditsong Cultural Museum in Visagie Street. The programme starts at 6.30pm. Events held so far include a film festival, a poetry-reading session, a gallery and handcraft exhibition. Mthethwa hailed the event as a special tribute to Struggle icons Mandela and Albertina Sisulu in their centenary year. It also raised the importance of “also remembering that Jerusalem remains the capital of Arab culture”. “As we celebrate our world icon Nelson Mandela and Mama Albertina Sisulu, we’re reminded that our leaders paved the way for the freedom we celebrate today,” said Mthethwa, noting that the event would not have been possible in South Africa under apartheid. “We’re delighted to host this event for the second time in South Africa.” John Makoni
