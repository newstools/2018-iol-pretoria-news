Sunnyside SAPS spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said they were investigating based on information received from the hospital. Mzuvukile Qaqoba, a final-year financial marketing Rosebank College student, had been reported missing by his family two weeks ago. Qaqoba, originally from Zwelitsha in the Eastern Cape, was discovered on the side of a road in Arcadia, where he was living. His mother said the family learnt about his whereabouts last week after they started looking for him at various hospitals. Noxolo Qaqoba said the hospital told them that he was recorded as an unknown patient. Hospital records indicated he was a victim of a hit-and-run. “Records indicate that he was admitted on November 3 after he was discovered by paramedics on the side of a road in Arcadia.” Noxolo said she went to visit him, and he still could not talk and appeared to have been badly injured in the head. “He is still in ICU. He seemed to be recovering even though he still could not talk. “According to a report from the hospital, seemingly it was a hit-and-run, but I’m not sure what exactly happened. The hospital did not give us the details of the person who phoned the ambulance,” she said. Noxolo said her son disappeared after a confrontation with a Congolese man he allegedly owed R200. However, police could not confirm the allegation. The mother said she feared the suspect might come for her son. “The hospital said they found some documents, including a passport, in my son’s possession belonging to a Congolese man who they later phoned to let him know what they found. “They told him there is an unknown patient who had his passport. It is risky because he might come back and finish him off. Police told us that no one has been arrested."
