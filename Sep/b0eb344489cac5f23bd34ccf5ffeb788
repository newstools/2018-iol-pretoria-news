Letting millions of South Africans watch with disappointment how deep the rot is with proceedings unfolding at the State Capture commission must never happen again. And it is with that goal in mind that academics, public and private stakeholders once again reaffirmed their commitment to the country’s constitutional values and principles. The initiative by the Public Service Commission held at Unisa’s main campus earlier today, saw stakeholders signing a pledge to bring back pride and caring to public service once more. The Commission launched the signing under the theme: “Building a value-driven public service through ethical leadership for service delivery.” Dr. Mpilo Sithole, Commissioner with the Public Service Commission, said the revival of constitutional values could not be more necessary. This as reports of public servants being preoccupied with social media, departments not responding to other department's queries, empty service desks, rumours of sex for jobs and many other problems have come flooding in. “Now is the time more than ever that such reports must come to an end and we need to bring back caring service to the people of this country.” Minister for Public Service and Administration, Ayanda Dlodlo, Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Service Administration Planning Monitoring and Evaluation, Joseph Maswanganyi, Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi and various non-governmental and private organisations representatives were all in attendance to sign the pledge. All with the clear message that: “Corruption had no place in Gauteng Province. ours is to deliver services,” said Vadi.
