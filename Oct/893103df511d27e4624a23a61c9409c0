Theunis Brink, 62, spent more than two months in the Tshwane District Hospital after the incident. He is claiming more than R900 000 in damages from the City. The City did not file papers to oppose the matter. The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, ruled the City 100% liable for the damages which Brink could prove he had suffered. Brink, who is unemployed, stated that on March 18 last year he visited a friend who lived in Wolmer in Pretoria North to watch a rugby game. He walked to his friend’s house earlier that night and he planned on walking home again after the match. “I wanted to walk back home, but it started to rain. I waited for it to stop before I embarked on my journey. It was getting late and the rain did not stop, so I phoned another friend to fetch me as I did not want to get wet.” Brink said the friend parked across the road. “I ran outside and I had to cross the road. At that stage it was raining hard and the road was covered in water. I could not see the surface. I simply accepted the integrity of the road would be in place as I did not have any reason to believe otherwise.” Brink said there were no signs indicating potholes or any warnings of roadworks. He crossed the road which was a single lane in each direction for the traffic. It was dark and the streetlights were not working. As he crossed to the last lane he stepped into a deep pothole, which was close to the edge of the road. He fell and severely injured his right leg. He blamed the City for the incident and said it had allowed Veldkornet Roos Street to deteriorate to such an extent that a pothole formed. The City was well aware of the pothole as two of his friends who lived nearby had reported the pothole numerous times, he said. “The pothole was of such a nature that it was dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.” Brink said it was the City's clear duty to maintain the road which it was responsible for.
