Some said at the time they had been waiting since the early hours of the morning, and the gates remained closed. First a few young men were helped up, followed by a few women. African Agency News (ANA) freelance photographer Bongani Shilubane was there to capture the moment. This photograph has now been selected as a finalist in one of the 17 categories of the prestigious Standard Bank Sikuvile awards. Shilubane is among four photographers for ANA whose pictures are under consideration for prizes. The others are Cindy Waxa, Phando Jikelo and Ayanda Ndamane from the Cape Town office. Jikelo - who won a Sikuvile award last year - is like Shilubane a finalist this year for a news photograph of former President Jacob Zuma as he was being mocked in Parliament, while Ndamaneâ€™s picture is of a student being manhandled during a #FeesMustFall protest. Waxa captured foreign children who are being taught in a makeshift school after they could not be accommodated in local schools and is a finalist in the features category. The winners will be announced at an event in September. Also to be named will be Story of the year, Upcoming/rising star of the year, Journalist of the year and the Allan Kirkland Soga Lifetime Achiever Award. The award-winning Gupta Leaks story, with a joint team of Daily Maverick/Amabhungane/News24 is a finalist in the investigative journalism category, along with The Times, Financial Mail and Saturday Dispatch.
