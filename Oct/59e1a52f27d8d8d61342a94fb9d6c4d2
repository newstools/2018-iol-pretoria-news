Speaking to the Pretoria News, she said she was honoured by the gesture. “I'm obsessed with roses. "It's such an honour, for me it means it's important to have your work honored and it's important for people to see your spirit and soul and want to immortalise that. "It's surreal, I mean I was crying when I saw that bed of roses like oh my God I'm in full bloom,” she said. The rose called "Nomzamo" rose, is a South African-bred rose that produces an endless supply of cleanly petalled rosette-shaped blooms with a light fragrance. The colour is a warm salmon apricot. It grows into a sturdy shrub with glossy green leaves that show off the appealing blooms. The rose will have pride of place in the massive display that forms the centre of Spring Rose Festival.
