The shaky cellphone footage, sneakily shot in the dressing room at Loftus Versfeld Stadium, shows Currie Cup captain Hanro Liebenberg addressing fellow team mates. The group included flyhalf Manie Libbok, loose forward Hendre Stassen, centre Johnny Kotze, and a few others who cannot be seen on the footage. The basic content of the clip shows Liebenberg opening up with raw emotion to his teammates, outlining just how much the Currie Cup means to him, and the mindset that they as a team should approach it with. The video raised a few light-hearted questions among management, fans and players: “Who was the culprit who managed to get away with shooting it? How did he/she do it without being noticed? “And, more importantly, how do we thank the person for sharing our sentiment with the public?”   Approached for comment, Liebenberg smiled broadly. “It’s actually nice to see positive messaging leaked to the media, especially in a time when there has been a bit of negativity around the brand. “The team often have similar chats, where we are encouraged to open up. It helps build brotherhood. At first I was surprised to see it on social media, but then realised it was probably great to share with rugby fans, getting them excited for the Currie Cup.” Pretoria News
