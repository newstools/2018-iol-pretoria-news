Spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the department did not discuss its operational matters. The claim was made by officers who alleged the department was running “significantly low” on ammunition. According to the officers, the lack of ammunition had rendered the Akasia Shooting Range obsolete. But Mahamba said the availability of ammunition or the lack of it was an operational matter. “We have internal structures to discuss these matters and department officials know about the established structures to discuss it. “Anybody with concerns within the metro police knows where to go.”The officers said the armoury was running low on bullets for shotguns and LM rifles. “This is the worst time for this to happen because the country is experiencing serious crimes and numerous cash-in-transit heists.” They alleged they had not been giving most of the officers new bullets and this problem dated back to April. The officers claimed they had discovered the department had not appointed a service provider to supply bullets in bulk. The officers said the armoury was extending officers’ firearm permissions even when their declaration of compliance had expired. They said this was done to avoid firearms being taken from the officers, as rules did not allow them to carry firearms without permits. The officers claimed they were initially given the impression the department would have new ammunition after the beginning of the current financial year.
