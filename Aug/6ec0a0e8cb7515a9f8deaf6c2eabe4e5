ProKid, 37, died of a severe seizure on Wednesday while visiting friends. Paramedics were called in to assist, but were unable to revive him. He died at 8.38pm. “The news of his untimely death came as a shock to me because we were never informed that he was not well. “Making it worse is the fact that he was such a young, yet talented musician. “It would be recalled that the likes of ProKid were trendsetters in this genre of music because they were among those who introduced it to the youth of our country and took it to the level it is at today,” Magwaza-Msibi said. “One of the important things we will always remember about ProKid is his clean life, dedication and courage to excel. “He was a rare breed of musicians who never forgot his roots. "More importantly, ProKid never allowed his celebrity status to get the better of him as he remained humble,” she said. ProKid's numerous albums, including the 2005 debut “Heads and Tales”, “Dankie San” in 2007, and Snakes & Ladders in 2009, earned him numerous awards from the HYPE Awards and the Channel O Music Video Awards. Hip hop artists including Slikour of Skwatta Kamp, JR and AKA, all paid tribute to the “Number One Soweto Boy” - as he usually referred to himself - saying he had inspired their music journeys but remained humble. ProKid leaves behind his wife Ayanda and 3-year-old daughter Nonkanyezi. The family have requested privacy during this time of mourning. His distraught relatives said they would update the media about funeral arrangements. - African News Agency (ANA)
