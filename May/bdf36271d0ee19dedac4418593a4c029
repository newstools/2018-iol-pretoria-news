Professor Toni Griffin, a Harvard professor in the Practice of Urban Planning, is founding director of Urban Planning and Design for the American City which investigates how urban planning and transformation can promote social equity. While in Pretoria she engaged with City of Tshwane planning officials and University of Pretoria academics and students of architecture and the built environment. Speaking at a reception hosted by US Chargé d’Affaires Elizabeth McKay, Griffin said she was delighted her work on design practice for just and resilient cities found its way to South Africa as there were commonalities in dealing with a range of urban issues - from public safety and security to quality and affordable housing, and ways to use public space to create greater social cohesion, for example. She has a full programme of meetings in Johannesburg before heading for Cape Town where discussions centre around “Corridors of Freedom”, a spatial planning principle around mixed-use corridors aimed at mitigating the impact of apartheid planning which left many people living far from work, facilities and services. For Griffin, the visit is an opportunity to understand the way in which South African cities operate and how they are using planning as a framework for decision-making and transformative investments which can address inequality. She has worked with a number of US cities, notably on the Detroit Future City, a framework plan for urban transformation. When it comes to housing, Griffin says the US too is still “living the legacy of spatial segregation despite the Fair Housing Act” which made it illegal to discriminate against tenants or buyers on the basis of race. “The dismantling of segregation policies is hard work, but I have seen a commitment (in SA) from people to find ways to do so. Regulation is an important tool, but you have to use the private sector and the market too,” she said. “You need vision planning to help guide where you want growth.”
