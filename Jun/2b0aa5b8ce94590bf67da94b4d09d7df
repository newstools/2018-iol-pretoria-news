"We only have one nurse to care for all our children and the nurse works shifts, meaning if she's not here then we don't have anyone. "We have a challenge of space because now we have three social workers sharing an office and they complain of lack of privacy with the children which is understandable. "However, the department of social development is currently building an administrative building which will have fourteen offices where our social workers will be able to have their privacy," she said. She told De Goede that the biggest challenge they ever faced at the institution was during staff protests last year in March which lasted for a month. She said she had expected the protest to last a day but little did she know that the vulnerable children the institution cared for would be left alone for an entire month. It was the most challenging month of our lives because all staff members were off except for the three of us managers. "Staff members barricaded all the entrances, they wouldn't let anyone in or out of this place, we were also locked inside with the children. "They turned away ambulances, service providers and the police, they were so violent," she explained. The institution based in Ga-Rankuwa Zone 2 currently caters for 49 children
