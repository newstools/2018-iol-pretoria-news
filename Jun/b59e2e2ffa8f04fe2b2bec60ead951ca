At a press conference in Joburg yesterday, Naidoo said she “stupidly copied and pasted” the response from a friend in a feeble attempt to appear “smart” on social media without reading it comprehensively. Naidoo reached out to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions SA after the post seen as demeaning towards Gaza sparked a fierce backlash. It included some of her sponsors cancelling their contracts with her. Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions SA  spokesperson Mohamed Desai said: “Shashi Naidoo has taken a decision to accept our proposal of going on a fact-finding visit to Palestine. “The visit will be guided by the National Council of Churches, as well as the South African Jews For a Free Palestine.” Desai said the organisation condemned all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism. It also decried all forms of violence, including death threats, that had allegedly been received by Naidoo. “We fully accept the apology by Shashi Naidoo and we can all learn from this. Please don't copy and paste,” Desai added. The National Council of Churches also accepted Naidoo’s apology and said the trip would serve to educate Naidoo. Shashi said she and her mother would pay for the trip. - African News Agency (ANA)
