Thereafter, the school participated in the 8th e-Icon World Contest in Hawaii, an e-Learning Olympics, and finished second. From the 167 choirs from 59 countries that took part in the World Choir Games, Crawford was second in South Africa and third Worldwide in one of the categories. Choir conductor and teacher Lebogang Mashabela said the choir of 20 girls went to the Choir Games for the experience. The choir was started over a year and a half ago, and the girls had so far not received any professional training. “We were ranked third in the world, under the Folk Lore Acapella, an experience that was life changing for them. Not only did they interact with the big choirs in the world, they also performed on the same stage as them. The girls were enthusiastic because prior to the games we had been practising for six months and we eventually went from just singing the songs to feeling the music to singing from the heart. “For people who do not have professional training and the fact that the choir was not even two years old, they killed the performances. "Our practices before were practically repertoires only to be on stage for 15 minutes and next thing you know it is all over but it was all worth it." Mashabela said the choir girls had since been walking around the school as if “they owned the world”.
